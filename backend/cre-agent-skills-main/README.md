# CRE Agent Skills — AI-Powered Commercial Real Estate Analysis

**66 CRE skills. No orchestrator required.**

Most CRE operators don't need another AI platform.

They need one sharp tool for the thing on their desk right now. The rent roll they're cleaning tonight. The IC memo due Thursday. The lender comparison they've been avoiding for a week. The quarterly LP report due Friday.

So I took my own orchestrator apart and gave it to them.

A while back I shipped a full multi-agent [CRE Acquisition Orchestrator](https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-acquisition-orchestrator) — 31 skills wired together across due diligence, underwriting, financing, legal, closing, and document ingestion. Some operators loved it. They wanted the full stack running like a junior analyst team that never sleeps.

But most people I talked to didn't want that.

Not yet.

They had a specific piece of work already in front of them. They didn't want to adopt a whole system. They wanted one good tool for the one thing they were doing right now.

The all-in-one AI platform pitch is a bad fit for how CRE work actually moves. Deals don't wait for you to adopt a pipeline. They land on your desk in pieces.

So I pulled every skill out.

Made each one a clean, standalone file you drop into your own setup — Claude Code, Claude Projects, ChatGPT, Cursor, or any LLM-powered tool.

Then I kept going.

Added a full **Industrial** pack.

Added a **Brokerage Investment Sales** pack.

Added an **Asset Management** pack for post-acquisition operations — budgets, variance, renewals, capex execution, NOI improvement, hold/sell/refi decisions, and quarterly LP reviews.

Added an **Office** pack for lease-driven office analysis - flight-to-quality, stacking plans, lease abstracts, rollover exposure, TI/LC-heavy underwriting, tenant credit, financing fit, and IC memo writing.

Added a **Capital Markets** pack for the messy refinance and maturity work everyone is dealing with now - debt maturity diagnostics, proceeds gaps, extensions, workouts, rescue capital, CMBS special servicing readiness, lender updates, and recap IC memos.

Built knowledge bases — real references, not placeholders. Every benchmark traces to a cited source.

Grab it. Apache 2.0. No API keys. No signup. Clone, star, come back.

Here's where I want to land.

I want this to be the most helpful AI resource in commercial real estate. Period. Not a product I sell. A growing set of building blocks you pick from. Scaffolding for the work you're already trying to think through.

### Option 3: Point an AI Agent at This Repo

If you're using an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.), you can point it at this repo and ask it to set things up for you:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-agent-skills.git
cd cre-agent-skills

# Then tell your AI agent:
# "Read the README.md and set up the CRE skills I need for due diligence and underwriting"
```

The repo is structured so an AI agent can read this README, understand the full skill catalog, and help you install exactly what you need. Every file is plain Markdown — no compilation, no build steps, no configuration files.

---

### How to Install

Each plugin is a self-contained directory inside `claude-code-plugins/`. Install the ones you need:

#### Method A: Personal Skills (Available in All Projects)

Copy plugins to your personal Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-agent-skills.git
cd cre-agent-skills

# Install individual plugins
cp -r claude-code-plugins/cre-due-diligence ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r claude-code-plugins/cre-underwriting ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r claude-code-plugins/cre-financing ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r claude-code-plugins/cre-legal ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r claude-code-plugins/cre-closing ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r claude-code-plugins/cre-document-ingestion ~/.claude/skills/

# Or install ALL plugins at once
cp -r claude-code-plugins/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

PowerShell equivalent:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-agent-skills.git
Set-Location .\cre-agent-skills

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.claude\skills" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse .\claude-code-plugins\* "$HOME\.claude\skills\"
```

After installation, the plugins are available in every Claude Code session. Type `/cre-` and autocomplete will show all installed plugins.

#### Method B: Project-Level Skills (Available in One Project)

If you want skills scoped to a specific deal or project:

```bash
# Inside your project directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills

# Install only the plugins you need for this project
cp -r /path/to/cre-agent-skills/claude-code-plugins/cre-due-diligence .claude/skills/
cp -r /path/to/cre-agent-skills/claude-code-plugins/cre-underwriting .claude/skills/
```

PowerShell equivalent:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force .\.claude\skills | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse C:\path\to\cre-agent-skills\claude-code-plugins\cre-industrial .\.claude\skills\
```

Brokerage v1 example:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force .\.claude\skills | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse C:\path\to\cre-agent-skills\claude-code-plugins\cre-brokerage .\.claude\skills\
```

Office v1 example:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force .\.claude\skills | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse C:\path\to\cre-agent-skills\claude-code-plugins\cre-office .\.claude\skills\
```

Capital Markets v1 example:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force .\.claude\skills | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse C:\path\to\cre-agent-skills\claude-code-plugins\cre-capital-markets .\.claude\skills\
```

Project-level skills take priority over personal skills with the same name. You can commit the `.claude/skills/` directory to git so your team shares the same skills.

#### Method C: Using `--add-dir` (No Installation)

Reference the plugins directory directly without copying:

```bash
# Clone once
git clone https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-agent-skills.git

# Launch Claude Code with the plugins directory
claude --add-dir /path/to/cre-agent-skills/claude-code-plugins/cre-due-diligence
```

This loads the plugin for the current session only. Skills from `--add-dir` directories are detected automatically and support live editing — you can modify skill files during a session without restarting.

### Using the Plugins

Once installed, invoke any plugin with its slash command:

```bash
# Due Diligence
/cre-due-diligence Analyze this rent roll for Parkview Apartments, 200 units, Austin TX

```

Claude reads the `SKILL.md` entry point, identifies which specialist skill to load based on your request, loads the full skill instructions plus relevant knowledge bases, and runs the analysis.

### Plugin Structure (For Reference)

Each plugin follows this pattern:

```
cre-{department}/
├── SKILL.md          # Entry point — YAML frontmatter + routing logic
├── skills/           # Specialist skill files (the actual analysis prompts)
│   ├── skill-one.md
│   ├── skill-two.md
│   └── ...
└── knowledge/        # Domain knowledge reference files (formulas, benchmarks, criteria)
    ├── relevant-knowledge-base-1.md
    └── relevant-knowledge-base-2.md
```

The `SKILL.md` file contains YAML frontmatter that tells Claude Code:
- `name` — the slash command name (e.g., `cre-due-diligence`)
- `description` — when Claude should automatically consider using this skill
- `argument-hint` — what to show in autocomplete

The body of `SKILL.md` routes the user's request to the right specialist skill file, which Claude loads on demand. Knowledge base files provide reference data (formulas, benchmarks, criteria) that the specialist skills draw on.

---

## Installation Methods

Different AI platforms have different ways to load skills. Here's how to use them everywhere:

### Claude Code (Plugins — Recommended)

See [Claude Code Plugins](#claude-code-plugins-recommended) above for the full setup guide. This is the best experience — you get slash commands, automatic routing, and bundled knowledge bases.

### Claude Projects (claude.ai)

1. Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and create a new Project
2. Click "Add knowledge" in the Project settings
3. Upload the `.md` skill file(s) you want to use from the `skills/` directory
4. Optionally upload knowledge base files from `knowledge/` that the skill recommends
5. Start a conversation — Claude automatically references the loaded skills

**Tip:** Name your project by deal (e.g., "Parkview Apartments DD") and load the relevant skill subset.

### ChatGPT (Custom GPTs)

1. Go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com) → Explore GPTs → Create
2. Paste the full content of a skill file into the "Instructions" field
3. Upload knowledge base files as the GPT's "Knowledge" documents
4. Save and use the GPT for that specific analysis task

### Cursor / Windsurf / AI Code Editors

Copy skill files into your editor's rules directory:

```bash
# Cursor
cp skills/due-diligence/rent-roll-analyst.md .cursor/rules/

# Or reference via --add-dir in Cursor's Claude Code integration
```

### Any LLM (API Usage)

Include skill content in your system prompt:

```python
import anthropic

skill = open("skills/due-diligence/rent-roll-analyst.md").read()
knowledge = open("knowledge/multifamily-benchmarks.md").read()

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    system=f"{skill}\n\n---\n\nReference Knowledge:\n{knowledge}",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this rent roll: [paste data]"}
    ]
)
```

## Example Usage

### Example: Rent Roll Analysis

**Step 1:** Load `skills/due-diligence/rent-roll-analyst.md` into your AI tool (or use `/cre-due-diligence` in Claude Code)

**Step 2:** Optionally also load `knowledge/multifamily-benchmarks.md` for market benchmarks

**Step 3:** Provide your inputs:

> Analyze this rent roll for Parkview Apartments, a 200-unit Class B multifamily at 1200 Park Avenue, Austin TX 78701.
>
> [paste rent roll data — unit numbers, tenant names, lease dates, monthly rents, deposits, status]
>
> Asking rents: Studio $1,050, 1BR $1,250, 2BR $1,550, 3BR $1,850

**Step 4:** Get back structured analysis — unit summary, occupancy metrics, loss-to-lease calculation, tenant concentration risks, anomalies, revenue projections, and confidence scoring.

## FAQ

### Do I need API keys to use these skills?

No. These are plain Markdown files. You load them into whatever AI tool you already use. There are no API calls, no external services, no dependencies.

### Can I use just one skill without installing everything?

Yes. Every skill file in the `skills/` directory is completely self-contained. Open the file, copy the content, paste it into your AI tool. You don't need the full repo.

### What's the difference between `skills/` and `claude-code-plugins/`?

The `skills/` directory contains individual `.md` files — one per analysis task. Use these when you want a single skill in any AI platform.

The `claude-code-plugins/` directory packages those same skills into department-level bundles for Claude Code, with a `SKILL.md` entry point that adds slash command support, automatic routing, and bundled knowledge bases. Use these if you're working in Claude Code and want the full department toolkit.

### How do the Claude Code plugins know which skill to use?

Each plugin's `SKILL.md` file contains a routing table. When you invoke `/cre-due-diligence Analyze this rent roll`, Claude reads the routing table, identifies that rent roll analysis maps to `skills/rent-roll-analyst.md`, loads that file, and follows its instructions. You don't need to know the individual skill file names.

### Can I modify the skills?

Yes. Apache 2.0 license — you can modify, extend, and redistribute. Fork the repo, adapt the skills to your firm's specific investment criteria, thresholds, or analysis standards. Just keep the attribution.

### How do these relate to the CRE Acquisition Orchestrator?

The [CRE Acquisition Orchestrator](https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-acquisition-orchestrator) is the full multi-agent pipeline — 31 agents with orchestration logic, phase dependencies, checkpoint/resume, JSON schema data contracts, and a real-time dashboard. It's the "enterprise system" that runs all these skills together in an automated pipeline.

This repo extracts those same agents into standalone skills you can use individually. All orchestration-specific code (checkpoints, logging protocols, pipeline data contracts) has been stripped. All domain expertise (formulas, thresholds, analysis logic, benchmarks) has been preserved.

### Can I use these for property types other than multifamily?

Yes. The original repo was optimized for multifamily acquisitions, and those skills remain intact. As of v1.1.0, the repo also includes **Industrial v1** for U.S. industrial acquisitions. As of v1.2.0, it includes **Brokerage Investment Sales v1** for U.S. seller-side commercial investment sales process work. As of v1.4.0, it includes **Office v1** for U.S. office acquisitions, refinancings, recapitalizations, lease-up, tenant credit, TI/LC underwriting, and IC memo writing. As of v1.5.0, it includes **Capital Markets v1** for debt maturities, refinance gaps, workouts, rescue capital, special servicing, and recap decisions across property types. Retail and self-storage are still planned future sector packs, though many shared, brokerage, and capital-markets workflows transfer.

## Want the Full Pipeline?

These skills are extracted from the [CRE Acquisition Orchestrator](https://github.com/ahacker-1/cre-acquisition-orchestrator) — a 31-agent multi-agent system that runs all of these skills together with:

- **Hierarchical orchestration** — master → phase → specialist agents
- **Phase dependencies and parallel execution** — Legal starts at DD 80%
- **JSON Schema data contracts** — every handoff validated at runtime
- **3-tier checkpoint/resume** — nothing lost on interruption
- **Real-time 9-tab React dashboard** — live pipeline visualization
- **Deterministic simulation engine** — no API keys needed to demo
- **Investment committee memo generation** — automated go/no-go verdict

If you want individual tools, you're in the right place. If you want the full automated pipeline, check out the orchestrator.
