## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill after running the capital markets diagnostics, refinance gap, rescue capital, term sheet, servicing, or lender package skills and needing a decision-ready memo.

## What You'll Need to Provide

- Outputs from relevant capital markets skills
- Property overview and current performance
- Existing debt, maturity, payoff, and default status
- Refinance gap and capital alternatives
- Business plan, risks, and exit strategy
- Sponsor objectives and decision deadline

## Mission

Synthesize the facts into a clear IC recommendation: refinance, extend, modify, recapitalize, inject equity, sell, pursue discounted payoff, or decline further capital.

---

## Strategy

### Step 1: Define the Decision

State the exact IC question:

- approve refinance
- approve paydown

- approve extension/workout proposal
- approve sale process
- decline additional capital

### Step 2: Summarize Current Position

Cover:

- asset status
- loan status
- maturity timeline
- operating performance
- valuation
- sponsor liquidity
- default or servicing risk

### Step 3: Present Alternatives

Compare:

- refinance
- extension
- workout/modification
- sponsor equity
- preferred equity or mezzanine
- common JV equity
- sale
- note purchase or discounted payoff

### Step 4: Analyze Economics and Risk

Include:

- proceeds gap
- required capital
- expected return or loss avoidance
- control and dilution
- downside case
- timing risk
- legal/tax/counsel issues

### Step 5: Make Recommendation

## Quality Checks

- States the exact IC decision
- Compares alternatives rather than advocating one path blindly
- Quantifies gap and required capital
- Names execution, consent, and control risks
- Includes conditions to approval
- Provides next actions with timing

---

## Red Flags & Dealbreakers

- Recommendation depends on unconfirmed lender consent
- Required capital exceeds value preserved
- Rescue capital structure creates immediate control-loss risk
- Sale is rejected without a refinance or recap path
- Tax, guaranty, or legal risk is material and unreviewed
- Memo hides uncertainty or missing data

---

## When Data is Missing

- If alternatives are incomplete, state what can and cannot be decided
- If economics are missing, write a preliminary screening memo only
- If legal/tax issues are unresolved, make counsel review a condition
- If value is unclear, include valuation sensitivity as a gating item

---

## Confidence Scoring

| Level | Criteria |
|---|---|
| HIGH | Prior skill outputs, financials, loan data, term sheets, value support, and sponsor objectives are available |
| MEDIUM | Main facts are available but one or more alternatives lack full terms |
| LOW | Memo relies on high-level narrative without validated financials or term sheets |
