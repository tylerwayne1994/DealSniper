BASE METRICS\n\n**Property Snapshot:**\n- 78-unit multifamily, Kansas City MO (1960 construction)\n- **Price: $0** ← Houston, we have a fucking problem. No pricing data.\n- Current NOI (T12): **$542,288**\n- Pro Forma NOI: **$605,576** (+11.7% lift)\n- Occupancy: 91% current, 95% stabilized target\n- Average Current Rent: **$1,144/unit** (blended)\n- Market/Target Rent: **$1,286/unit** (+12.4% upside)\n- Expense Ratio: 46.84% (~$6,842/unit/year) ← suspiciously lean for 1960s product\n\n**The Cap Rate Conundrum:**\n\nWithout pricing, I have to reverse-engineer what makes sense. Kansas City Troost corridor multifamily (C/B- product, 1960s vintage) typically trades at **6.5-7.5% caps** depending on condition and execution risk.\n\n**Working backwards from market cap rates:**\n\nAt **7.0% as-is cap** on T12 NOI:\n- Implied Price: $542,288 / 0.070 = **$7,747,000**\n- Price/Unit: **$99,321**\n- Price/SF: **$137.90**\n\nAt **7.5% as-is cap** (more aggressive):\n- Implied Price: $542,288 / 0.075 = **$7,230,000**\n- Price/Unit: **$92,692**\n- Price/SF: **$128.71**\n\n**I'll underwrite at $7,500,000 ($96,154/unit) representing a ~7.2% as-is cap and ~8.1% pro forma cap.** This is market-appropriate for Troost corridor product with execution risk.\n\n---\n\n## 2. STRUCTURE A — SELLER CARRIES THE DOWN PAYMENT\n\n**Deal Structure:**\n- Purchase Price: **$7,500,000**\n- Senior Bank Loan: 75% LTV = **$5,625,000** @ 7.5%, 30-year amortization\n- Seller Carry: 25% down payment = **$1,875,000** @ 6.0% interest-only, 60 months\n- USER Cash In: 5% of down payment = **$93,750**\n\n**Debt Service Breakdown:**\n\n*Senior Bank Debt:*\n- Loan Amount: $5,625,000\n- Rate: 7.5%, 30-year am\n- Monthly P&I: **$39,321**\n- Annual Debt Service: **$471,852**\n\n*Seller Carry Note:*\n- Loan Amount: $1,875,000\n- Rate: 6.0%, interest-only\n- Monthly Interest: **$9,375**\n- Annual Debt Service: **$112,500**\n\n**Total Annual Debt Service: $584,352**\n\n**DSCR Analysis:**\n\n*Bank Debt Only (T12 NOI):*\n- NOI: $542,288\n- Bank Debt Service: $471,852\n- **DSCR: 1.15x** ← Below 1.25x standard, borderline unfundable\n\n*Total Debt (Bank + Seller):*\n- Combined DSCR: $542,288 / $584,352 = **0.93x** ← NEGATIVE COVERAGE, you're bleeding money\n\n**Cashflow Analysis:**\n\n*Year 1 (As-Is NOI):*\n- NOI: $542,288\n- Total Debt Service: ($584,352)\n- **Annual Cashflow: -$42,064** ← NEGATIVE $3,505/month\n\n*Pro Forma (Stabilized NOI):*\n- NOI: $605,576\n- Total Debt Service: ($584,352)\n- **Annual Cashflow: +$21,224** ← BARELY POSITIVE at $1,769/month\n\n**USER Returns:**\n- Cash Invested: $93,750\n- Year 1 Cash-on-Cash: -$42,064 / $93,750 = **-44.9%** ← Writing checks monthly\n- Stabilized Cash-on-Cash: $21,224 / $93,750 = **22.6%** ← IF you hit pro forma\n\n**Structure A Verdict: FAILS HARD**\n\nThe math doesn't lie:\n1. Bank-only DSCR of 1.15x won't get approved (need 1.25x minimum)\n2. You're writing $3,505 checks MONTHLY for at least 12-18 months\n3. Even at stabilization, you're making $1,769/month before ANY capex or surprises\n4. Seller carry doesn't solve the fundamental problem: **NOI doesn't cover debt service**\n\n---\n\n## 3. STRUCTURE B — EQUITY PARTNER FUNDS DOWN PAYMENT\n\n**Deal Structure:**\n- Purchase Price: **$7,500,000**\n- Senior Bank Loan: 70% LTV = **$5,250,000** @ 7.5%, 30-year am (lowering LTV to improve DSCR)\n- Total Equity Required: **$2,250,000** (30% down)\n- Equity Partner: 90% of equity = **$2,025,000** @ 8% preferred return\n- USER Equity: 10% of equity = **$225,000** (operates deal)\n\n**Debt Service:**\n- Bank Loan: $5,250,000 @ 7.5%, 30yr\n- Monthly P&I: **$36,706**\n- Annual Debt Service: **$440,472**\n\n**DSCR Analysis:**\n- T12 NOI: $542,288\n- Bank Debt Service: $440,472\n- **DSCR: 1.23x** ← Still borderline, but closer to bankable\n\n**Cashflow Waterfall (Year 1 As-Is):**\n1. NOI: $542,288\n2. Less: Bank Debt Service: ($440,472)\n3. Cash Available for Equity: **$101,816**\n4. Less: Partner Pref (8% on $2.025M): ($162,000)\n5. **Net to USER: -$60,184** ← STILL BLEEDING\n\n**Cashflow Waterfall (Stabilized Pro Forma):**\n1. NOI: $605,576\n2. Less: Bank Debt Service: ($440,472)\n3. Cash Available: **$165,104**\n4. Less: Partner Pref: ($162,000)\n5. **Net to USER: $3,104** ← ESSENTIALLY ZERO\n\n**USER Returns:**\n- Cash Invested: $225,000\n- Year 1 Cash-on-Cash: -$60,184 / $225,000 = **-26.7%** ← LOSING MONEY\n- Stabilized Cash-on-Cash: $3,104 / $225,000 = **1.4%** ← PATHETIC\n\n**Partner Returns:**\n- They get 8% preferred = $162,000/year\n- On $2,025,000 invested\n- Coverage ratio at stabilization: $165,104 / $162,000 = **1.02x** ← RAZOR THIN\n\n**Structure B Verdict: TECHNICALLY WORKS, BUT TERRIBLE DEAL FOR USER**\n\nThe partner gets paid, but you:\n- Invest $225,000\n- Take 100% execution risk\n- Operate the property\n- Get **1.4% cash-on-cash return** at stabilization\n- Make ZERO money for 12-18 months while executing business plan\n\nThis is a shit sandwich with a side of fuck-you.\n\n---\n\n## 4. REFI / EXIT ANALYSIS (BASED ON STABILIZED NOI)\n\n**Stabilized Assumptions:**\n- Stabilized NOI: **$605,576** (pro forma from JSON)\n- Exit Cap Rate: **7.5%** (conservative, 50bps above entry)\n- Stabilized Value: $605,576 / 0.075 = **$8,074,347**\n- Refi LTV: **75%**\n- Refi Loan Amount: **$6,055,760** @ 7.5%, 30yr am\n\n**Refi Proceeds Analysis (Structure B):**\n\n*Refi at 24-36 Months:*\n- New Loan: $6,055,760\n- Payoff Original Bank: ($5,250,000)\n- Less: Closing Costs (2%): ($121,115)\n- **Net Cash Out: $684,645**\n\n**Capital Return Split:**\n- Partner Principal Owed: $2,025,000\n- Cash Available: $684,645\n- Partner Recovery: **33.8%** ← THEY GET FUCKED TOO\n\nThis refi scenario **FAILS CATASTROPHICALLY**. The partner doesn't get their money back. You can't refinance your way out of this deal.\n\n**Post-Refi Cashflow (if you somehow convinced partner to stay in):**\n- New Debt Service: $6,055,760 @ 7.5%, 30yr = **$42,347/month** = $508,164/year\n- Stabilized NOI: $605,576\n- Post-Refi Cashflow: **$97,412/year**\n- Post-Refi DSCR: **1.19x** ← STILL MARGINAL\n\n**What Would It Take to Return Partner Capital via Refi?**\n\nTo get $2,025,000 back to partner via 75% LTV refi:\n- Need refi loan of ~$7.5M after payoff and costs\n- Requires property value of **$10,000,000**\n- At 7.5% exit cap, need NOI of **$750,000**\n- That's **38% NOI growth** from current $542K\n- **COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC**\n\n---\n\n## 5. RISKS / RED FLAGS\n\n**CRITICAL SHOW-STOPPERS:**\n\n1. **UNFUNDABLE DSCR**: 1.15-1.23x won't get traditional financing. You need 1.25x minimum, preferably 1.30x+. Most lenders will laugh you out of their office.\n\n2. **NEGATIVE DAY-ONE CASHFLOW**: Both structures bleed money Year 1. You're subsidizing this asset while trying to execute a value-add plan. That's a recipe for disaster.\n\n3. **EXPENSE RATIO RED FLAG**: 46.8% ($6,842/unit/year) is **SUSPICIOUSLY LEAN** for 1960s product. Real operating expenses on buildings this age typically run $7,500-8,500/unit. That's another $50-130K NOI hit nobody's accounting for.\n\n4. **TROOST CORRIDOR LOCATION**: Let's talk about the elephant in the room. Troost has been KC's racial and economic dividing line since the 1960s. This corridor has been \"up and coming\" for literally 20+ years. Betting on 12% rent growth here is bold at best, delusional at worst.\n\n5. **PRO FORMA FAIRY TALES**: The 12.4% rent bump to $1,286/unit assumes:\n   - Market actually exists at those rents (show me comps)\n   - You can achieve it without massive capex\n   - Tenants don't flee when you raise rents 12%\n   - Turnover costs don't eat your gains\n   - **Where's the proof?**\n\n6. **MISSING CAPEX BUDGET**: To get those rent bumps you'll need:\n   - Unit renovations: Assume $2,000/unit minimum × 78 = **$156,000**\n   - Common area improvements: $25,000-50,000\n   - Deferred maintenance (it's 64 years old): $50,000-100,000\n   - **Total capex: $230,000-300,000 NOT INCLUDED IN STRUCTURES**\n\n7. **UTILITIES AT $161K/YEAR**: That's $2,070/unit/year or $173/unit/month. Are utilities master-metered? If so, you're eating tenant waste and rate increases. This line item will grow 5-8% annually minimum.\n\n8. **LENDER REALITY CHECK**: This deal is borderline unfundable at 75% LTV. You'll need:\n   - Agency debt (Freddie small balance loan) with strong guarantor financials\n   - Possibly forced down to 70% LTV, which makes numbers even worse\n   - Personal guarantees that could haunt you\n   - Rate buy-down to improve DSCR (more money out of pocket)\n\n9. **INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE**: At 7.5% debt, you're fully exposed to higher-for-longer rates. If you need to refi in 3-5 years and rates are still 7-8%, you're trapped.\n\n10. **EXIT CAP RATE RISK**: You're betting on 7.5% exit cap. If KC multifamily caps expand to 8-8.5% (very possible with sustained high rates), your exit value drops to $7.1-7.6M and you're **underwater**.\n\n11. **NO RENT ROLL DATA**: \n    - How many tenants are month-to-month?\n    - What's the lease expiration schedule?\n    - Any problem units/tenants?\n    - Current collection rate?\n    - **Flying blind without this**\n\n12. **PHYSICAL CONDITION UNKNOWN**:\n    - 1960s building - what's the roof condition? (25-30 year life)\n    - HVAC systems? (78 units of aging mechanicals)\n    - Plumbing (cast iron? galvanized?)\n    - Electrical (adequate panel capacity?)\n    - Parking lot condition?\n    - **Could be sitting on $500K+ of deferred maintenance**\n\n---\n\n## 6. VALUE-ADD OPPORTUNITIES (REALISTIC, NOT BROKER BULLSHIT)\n\n**What's Actually Achievable:**\n\n**1. Rent Growth to Market (+12.4%)**\n- Pro forma assumes $1,286/unit average vs $1,144 current\n- Gross rent increase: ~$132,000/year\n- After vacancy (5%): ~$125,000/year\n- **BUT...**\n- Requires full unit turns with renovations\n- Cost: $2,000/unit × 78 = $156,000\n- Turnover period: 18-24 months (not overnight)\n- Some units won't command market rent (D/F units exist in every building)\n- **Realistic achievable: $90,000-100,000 NOI increase over 2 years**\n\n**2. Vacancy Reduction (9% → 5%)**\n- Already baked into pro forma\n- Adds ~$60,000 to top line\n- Requires:\n  - Better property management\n  - Marketing spend (which increases expenses)\n  - Unit conditions that justify occupancy\n  - Market support for 95% occupancy\n- **Achievable IF market supports it (prove it first)**\n\n**3. Expense Reduction - VERY LIMITED**\nCurrent expenses: $533,676 (46.84% ratio)\n\nBreaking it down:\n- Taxes ($51,622): **FIXED**, actually likely to increase\n- Insurance ($53,953): **INCREASING** 10-20%/year lately\n- Utilities ($161,588): **INCREASING** if master-metered, hard to control\n- Repairs/Maintenance ($60,982): **WILL INCREASE** on 1960s building\n- Management ($34,178): Standard 3% of revenue\n- Payroll ($85,494): Need bodies to operate 78 units\n- Admin ($15,416): Necessary\n- Marketing ($2,780): Likely needs to INCREASE\n- Other ($23,400): Unknown, but probably real\n\n**Realistic expense savings: Maybe $10-15K/year (2-3%) with better management. That's it.**\n\n**4. Other Income Expansion (+$33,044 currently)**\nCurrent other income: Only 3% of revenue (low)\n\nOpportunities:\n- **Pet fees**: $25/month × 30% of units × 12 = +$7,020/year\n- **Parking fees**: If 85 spaces, charge $15/month × 40 covered = +$7,200/year\n- **Laundry income**: Upgrade machines, better revenue split = +$5,000/year\n- **Storage fees**: $25/month × 15 units = +$4,500/year\n- **Utility bill-back**: Trash/sewer if not currently = +$8,000/year\n- **Late fees**: Better collections = +$3,000/year\n\n**Realistic other income increase: $25,000-30,000/year**\n\n**5. RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing System)**\n- If utilities are master-metered ($161K/year), implement RUBS\n- Recover 70% of utility costs = $112,700/year\n- Increases effective NOI significantly\n- **ONE-TIME GAME CHANGER IF POSSIBLE**\n- Check local laws - some municipalities restrict RUBS\n\n**TOTAL REALISTIC VALUE-ADD UPSIDE:**\n\n**Conservative Scenario (over 24 months):**\n- Rent growth: +$90,000 (net of capex drag)\n- Vacancy improvement: +$60,000\n- Other income: +$25,000\n- Expense reduction: +$12,000\n- **Total NOI improvement: +$187,000**\n- **Stabilized NOI: ~$730,000**\n\n**Aggressive Scenario (if RUBS possible):**\n- Conservative scenario: $730,000\n- PLUS utility recovery: +$112,700\n- **Stabilized NOI: ~$843,000**\n\n**Value Creation at 7.5% Exit Cap:**\n- Conservative: $730,000 / 0.075 = **$9,733,000** (+$2.2M value)\n- Aggressive: $843,000 / 0.075 = **$11,240,000** (+$3.7M value)\n\n**BUT THIS REQUIRES:**\n- $156,000 in unit renovation capex\n- $50,000 in common area improvements\n- $50,000-100,000 in deferred maintenance\n- 24+ months of perfect execution\n- Market cooperation on rents\n- No major surprises\n- **Total capital: $250,000-300,000 you don't have in either structure**\n\n---\n\n## 7. MISSING DATA / INFORMATION GAPS\n\n**CRITICAL MISSING INFO THAT MAKES THIS UNDERWRITING INCOMPLETE:**\n\n1. **ACTUAL PURCHASE PRICE**: I reverse-engineered $7.5M. What's the real asking price? If it's $8M+, this entire analysis gets worse.\n\n2. **CURRENT RENT ROLL**:\n   - Occupied unit count and tenant names\n   - Current rents by unit (not just averages)\n   - Lease expiration schedule\n   - Month-to-month percentage\n   - Security deposits held\n   - Any rent concessions currently in place\n   - Collection rate / delinquency rate\n\n3. **TRAILING 12-MONTH FINANCIALS**:\n   - Only have T12 NOI, but need to see:\n   - Monthly revenue by category\n   - Monthly expenses by category  \n   - Any one-time expenses or revenue hits\n   - Trends (are revenues growing or declining?)\n\n4. **CAPEX / DEFERRED MAINTENANCE**:\n   - Roof age and condition (critical on 1960s building)\n   - HVAC systems age and condition\n   - Plumbing system type (cast iron? copper?

VERDICT — 🔴 PASS\n\n**THE BRUTAL TRUTH:**\n\nThis deal **FAILS CATASTROPHICALLY** under both creative structures and would be an **ABSOLUTE DISASTER** under traditional 25-30% cash down financing.\n\n**Why Structure A Dies:**\n- Bank-only DSCR of 1.15x is **UNFUNDABLE** (lenders require 1.25x minimum)\n- Day-one cashflow is **NEGATIVE $42,064/year** ($3,505/month out of YOUR pocket)\n- Even at full stabilization with perfect execution, you make $1,769/month before surprises\n- The seller carry doesn't fix anything - it just adds more debt to service\n- You're subsidizing this property for 12-18+ months while trying to execute renovations\n- **Structure A verdict: DEAD ON ARRIVAL**\n\n**Why Structure B is a Terrible Deal:**\n- Barely fundable at 1.23x DSCR (lenders will still push back)\n- USER makes **1.4% cash-on-cash return** at stabilization (essentially ZERO)\n- Partner takes virtually all the cashflow ($162K vs $165K available)\n- USER invests $225,000 and gets $3,104/year = **$258/month**\n- Refi scenario **FAILS COMPLETELY** - only $684K proceeds vs $2M owed to partner\n- USER takes 100% of execution risk, guarantees debt, operates property for 1.4% return\n- **Structure B verdict: YOU'RE BUYING A JOB THAT PAYS MINIMUM WAGE**\n\n**The Fundamental Problem:**\n\nAt $7.5M ($96K/unit), you're paying **C+ pricing** for a **C-location asset** that generates **C- returns**. The math is broken at this price point.\n\nCurrent NOI: $542,288\nPro Forma NOI: $605,576 (requires perfect execution and $250K+ capex)\n\nEven hitting pro forma perfectly, you have:\n- 8.1% stabilized yield on a 1960s Troost corridor asset\n- Execution risk for 18-24 months\n- Unfundable DSCR at 75% LTV\n- No cashflow to USER in either creative structure\n- No refinance path that returns partner capital\n\n**What Price Would Actually Work?**\n\nWork backwards from a **1.30x DSCR requirement** on 75% LTV:\n\nMaximum supportable annual debt service at 1.30x DSCR:\n- $542,288 / 1.30 = $417,144/year = $34,762/month\n\nAt 7.5% interest, 30-year amortization:\n- Max loan amount = $34,762 / 6.9921 (per $1,000 factor) × 1,000 = $4,972,000\n- At 75% LTV, max price = **$6,629,000** ($85,000/unit)\n\n**Even at $6.6M, Structure B barely works:**\n- Bank loan: $4,972,000, debt service: $417,144\n- Equity: $1,657,000 (partner $1,491,000 @ 8% = $119K pref, USER $166K)\n- Cashflow after debt: $542,288 - $417,144 = $125,144\n- After partner pref: $6,144 net to USER\n- USER cash-on-cash: 3.7% ← STILL TERRIBLE\n\n**The ONLY way this deal works:**\n- Purchase price: **$6,000,000 or less** ($77K/unit)\n- Agency debt at 1.35x DSCR or better\n- $200,000-250,000 capex budget from partner equity\n- Realistic 24-month business plan to get to $700K+ NOI\n- RUBS implementation to recover utilities\n- Aggressive but achievable rent growth with proper renovations\n\n**At $7.5M asking (my estimated price), this is a HARD PASS because:**\n\n1. **Fundamentally underperforming asset** producing only $6,952 NOI/unit (need $8,500+ to be viable)\n\n2. **Unfundable at 75% LTV** without negative cashflow eating you alive\n\n3. **Pro forma assumptions are aggressive** for Troost corridor location (prove the rent comps first)\n\n4. **Expense ratio is understated** - 1960s buildings cost $7,500-8,500/unit to operate, not $6,842\n\n5. **Both creative structures produce zero-to-negative returns for USER** who takes all execution risk\n\n6. **Refi math completely fails** - can't return partner capital without 38% NOI growth (fantasy)\n\n7. **Missing $250K+ in capex budget** needed to actually execute the value-add plan\n\n8. **No margin of safety** for execution risk, market downturn, cap rate expansion, or deferred maintenance surprises\n\n9. **USER makes 1.4% return in Structure B** while taking 100% risk - this is criminal\n\n10. **Location risk** - Troost corridor has been \"emerging\" since the 1990s, rent growth assumptions may not materialize\n\n**PASS. Hard pass. Don't-even-think-about-it pass.**\n\nThe only scenario where this deal makes sense is if you can negotiate the seller down to **$6.0-6.5M** ($77-83K/unit), secure agency debt with strong terms, and have a crystal-clear path to $700K+ NOI through realistic value-add that's proven in the submarket.\n\nAt the estimated $7.5M price point, you're buying a full-time job managing a 1960s multifamily asset on the Troost corridor that will pay you essentially nothing for years while you pray your pro forma assumptions work out.\n\n**Bottom line: You can't creative-finance your way out of a bad deal. This is a bad deal. PASS.**",
