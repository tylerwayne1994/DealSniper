DEAL SNAPSHOT\n\n**Property Details:**\n- **Address:** 1611 E Lamar Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85016\n- **Market:** Camelback East/Arcadia — this is prime central Phoenix real estate. Walkable neighborhood, established wealth, urban infill. Strong fundamentals.\n- **Year Built:** 2024 (brand fucking new — literally just delivered)\n- **Units:** 4 units (luxury townhome-style fourplex)\n- **Property Type:** Multifamily\n- **Size:** 5,900 SF total rentable building area (1,475 SF/unit average — these are MASSIVE units)\n\n**Pricing:**\n- **Purchase Price:** $2,700,000\n- **Price/Unit:** $675,000 (you're paying single-family detached home prices per unit)\n- **Price/SF:** $457.63 (premium pricing for Phoenix multifamily)\n\n**Current Financials (Per Broker):**\n- **Gross Potential Rent:** $171,600/year ($14,300/month)\n- **Other Income:** $4,800/year\n- **Vacancy:** 5% ($8,580)\n- **Effective Gross Income:** $167,820\n- **Operating Expenses:** $26,223 \n- **Broker NOI:** $141,597\n- **Broker Cap Rate:** 5.25%\n\n**Occupancy:** Not disclosed — this is 100% pro forma on brand-new construction with ZERO operating history.\n\n**Who Pays Utilities:**\nThe ridiculously low $6,400/year utilities expense ($533/month total for 4 large units) tells us:\n- **Tenants:** Gas, electric (separately metered or possibly included in rent)\n- **Landlord:** Water, sewer, trash only\n\nIf landlord paid all utilities on 1,475 SF average units in Phoenix summer heat, you'd see $400-600/unit/month = $19,200-28,800/year.\n\n**⚠️ CRITICAL MISSING DATA:**\n- **No T12** (trailing 12-month actuals) — this is 100% pro forma fantasy\n- **No rent roll** showing actual occupancy, lease terms, or security deposits\n- **No rent comparables** to validate the $2,400/$4,750 pricing claims\n- **No operating history** whatsoever\n- **No disclosure of actual current occupancy** — could be 0%, 50%, 100%\n\n**You are underwriting pure speculation, not actual performance. This is a huge red flag.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. DAY-ONE FINANCIALS\n\n### **Reality Check: Normalized Operating Expenses**\n\nThe broker shows $26,223 total OpEx = **$6,556/unit/year** = **$547/unit/month**.\n\n**This is complete bullshit for a $2.7M luxury fourplex in Phoenix.**\n\nHere's what expenses ACTUALLY look like when you're not lying to yourself:\n\n| Expense Category | Broker's Fantasy | Real's Reality | Variance |\n|-----------------|------------------|----------------|----------|\n| **Property Taxes** | $3,211 | $8,100 | +$4,889 |\n| **Insurance** | $1,700 | $4,500 | +$2,800 |\n| **Utilities (W/S/T)** | $6,400 | $9,600 | +$3,200 |\n| **Repairs & Maintenance** | $4,400 | $9,600 | +$5,200 |\n| **Management (6% EGI)** | $6,712 | $10,069 | +$3,357 |\n| **Payroll** | $0 | $0 | $0 |\n| **Admin/Legal/Acct** | $2,050 | $3,000 | +$950 |\n| **Marketing/Leasing** | $750 | $2,400 | +$1,650 |\n| **Other** | $1,000 | $1,000 | $0 |\n| **Reserves (CapEx)** | $0 | $4,800 | +$4,800 |\n| **TOTAL** | **$26,223** | **$53,069** | **+$26,846** |\n\n**Why These Adjustments:**\n\n1. **Property Taxes:** Broker shows 0.12% of value. Phoenix post-sale reassessment = 0.30% minimum. $2,700,000 × 0.003 = **$8,100/year**. This will hit you in Year 2.\n\n2. **Insurance:** $1,700 doesn't cover a $2.7M new construction building. Market rate in Phoenix = $0.75-1.00/SF. 5,900 SF × $0.76 = **$4,500/year** minimum.\n\n3. **Utilities:** If landlord only pays W/S/T, realistic cost = $200/unit/month = **$9,600/year** (not $533/month for all 4 units combined).\n\n4. **Repairs & Maintenance:** Even brand new buildings need landscaping, HVAC service contracts, pest control, handyman work, pool/spa service (if applicable). $200/unit/month = **$9,600/year** is market standard.\n\n5. **Management:** Should be 6% of EGI minimum for institutional quality. $167,820 × 0.06 = **$10,069**. Broker used 4% to make numbers look better.\n\n6. **Marketing:** For luxury units at $2,400-$4,750/month, you need professional photography, 3D virtual tours, premium listing placement on Zillow/Apartments.com. $50/unit/month = **$2,400/year**.\n\n7. **Reserves (CapEx):** Any lender requires $100/unit/month minimum = **$4,800/year**. You WILL need this for roof/HVAC/parking lot/interior systems in years 10-15.\n\n---\n\n### **Actual Day-One NOI:**\n\n- **Effective Gross Income:** $167,820\n- **Realistic Operating Expenses:** $53,069\n- **Actual NOI:** **$114,751**\n\n**Actual Cap Rate:** $114,751 / $2,700,000 = **4.25%**\n\n**The broker inflated NOI by $26,846 (23%) through fabricated expenses. This is a 4.25-cap deal, not 5.25-cap. You're buying at Silicon Valley pricing in Phoenix.**\n\n---\n\n### **Debt Service & DSCR Calculation**\n\n**Loan Structure (75% LTV, current market):**\n- **Loan Amount:** $2,025,000 (75% of $2,700,000)\n- **Down Payment:** $675,000 (25%)\n- **Interest Rate:** 7.0% (current multifamily rate for good credit)\n- **Term:** 30 years\n- **Amortization:** 30 years\n\n**Monthly Debt Service Calculation:**\n\nUsing standard mortgage payment formula: \nMonthly Payment = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]\n\nWhere:\n- P = $2,025,000\n- r = 0.07/12 = 0.005833 (monthly rate)\n- n = 360 payments\n\n**Monthly Payment:** $13,467\n**Annual Debt Service:** $161,604\n\n---\n\n### **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio):**\n\n**DSCR = NOI / Annual Debt Service**\n\n$114,751 / $161,604 = **0.710** ❌\n\n**This deal FAILS TO QUALIFY for standard bank financing.** \n\nLenders require minimum 1.25 DSCR (some will go to 1.20 for strong borrowers with perfect credit and significant reserves). You're at 0.71.\n\n**Translation: You literally cannot get a conventional loan for this property at standard 75% LTV.**\n\nTo make this work with a bank, you'd need:\n- 35-40% down payment ($945K-1.08M cash)\n- Or seller carry (see Section 4)\n- Or pray you find a hard money lender at 10%+ rates\n\n---\n\n### **Day-One Monthly Cashflow:**\n\n- **Monthly NOI:** $9,563 ($114,751 / 12)\n- **Monthly Debt Service:** -$13,467\n- **Net Monthly Cashflow:** **-$3,904** ❌\n\n**Annual Cashflow:** **-$46,853** ❌\n\n**You lose $3,904 every single month from day one. That's burning $47K/year while you pray for appreciation.**\n\n---\n\n### **Cash-on-Cash Return:**\n\n**Total Cash Invested:**\n- Down Payment: $675,000\n- Closing Costs (3% estimate): $81,000\n- **Total:** $756,000\n\n**CoC Return:** -$46,853 / $756,000 = **-6.2%** ❌\n\nYou're literally paying 6.2% per year to own this property while a 10-year Treasury yields 4.5% risk-free and the S&P averages 10%.\n\n---\n\n### **🚨 BROKER BULLSHIT IDENTIFIED:**\n\n| Broker Lie | NOI Impact | How They Did It |\n|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Understated taxes | +$4,889 | Used legacy pre-sale assessment, ignored post-sale reassessment spike |\n| Understated insurance | +$2,800 | Used fantasy insurance quote or developer's master policy rate |\n| Understated utilities | +$3,200 | Unclear who pays what, massively low-balled W/S/T costs |\n| Understated R&M | +$5,200 | Ignored landscaping, HVAC contracts, ongoing maintenance reality |\n| Management at 4% not 6% | +$3,357 | Used below-market rate to inflate NOI |\n| No reserves | +$4,800 | Pretended CapEx doesn't exist |\n| Understated marketing | +$1,650 | Ignored luxury product marketing needs |\n| **TOTAL NOI INFLATION** | **+$26,846 (23%)** | **Standard broker fuckery to make deal look better** |\n\n**The broker manufactured a 5.25% cap rate by fabricating expenses. Real cap rate is 4.25%. This is institutional pricing on a 4-unit property with zero operating history.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. VALUE-ADD OPPORTUNITIES\n\n### **A. RENT UPSIDE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Current Unit Mix & Rents:**\n- **2 × 1BR/1BA (850 SF):** $2,400/month each = $2.82/SF\n- **2 × 3BR/2BA (2,110 SF):** $4,750/month each = $2.25/SF\n- **Total Current Rent:** $14,300/month ($171,600/year)\n\n**Phoenix Luxury Multifamily Market Context (Q4 2024):**\n\nCamelback East/Arcadia is a premium Phoenix submarket, but let's reality-check these rents:\n\n- **1BR Class A:** $1,800-2,600/month ($2.00-2.80/SF typical for 700-900 SF units)\n- **3BR Class A:** $2,800-5,200/month ($1.60-2.50/SF typical for 1,800-2,400 SF units)\n\n**Current Rent Analysis:**\n- 1BR at $2.82/SF = **at the top of market** for luxury product\n- 3BR at $2.25/SF = **solid market rate** for large luxury units\n\n**Phoenix Multifamily Market Reality Check:**\n\nPhoenix has been OVERSUPPLYING luxury multifamily for 3+ years. Thousands of new units delivered 2022-2024. Remote work exodus from California slowed significantly post-2022. Rents have been flat to slightly declining in many submarkets.\n\n**Realistic Rent Upside: $0 in Year 1**\n\nThe seller has already pushed rents to market ceiling on brand-new product. You're not buying under-market rents — you're buying peak-market rents with downside risk if Phoenix oversupply worsens.\n\n**Conservative Rent Growth Projection (3% annually):**\n\nThis assumes Phoenix economy stays strong and supply/demand stabilizes:\n\n- Year 1: +$5,148/year gross income\n- Less 5% vacancy: **+$4,891 net rent growth**\n\nThis is inflation-based growth, not value-add. You're not fixing anything or pushing rents from below market.\n\n---\n\n### **B. RUBS (RATIO UTILITY BILLING SYSTEM) POTENTIAL**\n\n**Current Utility Expense:** $6,400/year ($533/month total)\n\nThis low number confirms tenants already pay gas/electric separately or it's included in base rent. Landlord pays water/sewer/trash only.\n\n**RUBS Implementation Strategy:**\n\nBill back W/S/T to tenants based on unit size:\n- 1BR units (850 SF): $150/month × 2 units = $3,600/year\n- 3BR units (2,110 SF): $200/month × 2 units = $4,800/year\n- **Total RUBS Revenue Potential:** $8,400/year\n\n**BUT** — major caveat for luxury product:\n\nThese are luxury units at $2,400-$4,750/month. Tenants at this price point often expect utilities included. If you bill back W/S/T on renewal, you risk:\n- Tenant pushback/non-renewal (luxury renters have options)\n- Needing to reduce base rent to compensate (market forces)\n- Competitive disadvantage vs other luxury units that include utilities\n\n**Conservative RUBS Implementation Impact:**\n\nAssuming 50-60% implementation success accounting for tenant friction, partial-year rollout, and market resistance:\n\n**Realistic RUBS NOI Increase: +$5,000/year**\n\n---\n\n### **C. EXPENSE REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES**\n\nOnce expenses are normalized to reality, there's limited cut potential on a brand-new 4-unit property:\n\n| Expense | Realistic Budget | Reduction Potential | Notes |\n|---------|------------------|-------------------|--------|\n| Taxes | $8,100 | $0 | Set by county assessor |\n| Insurance | $4,500 | $0 | Need proper coverage |\n| Utilities | $9,600 | -$6,400 | Via RUBS (captured above) |\n| R&M | $9,600 | $0 | Already lean for new property |\n| Management | $10,069 | -$1,000 | Negotiate to 5.5% if self-managing some |\n| Reserves | $4,800 | $0 | Non-negotiable for lender |\n| Admin | $3,000 | -$500 | Minor optimization possible |\n| Marketing | $2,400 | $0 | Need it for luxury positioning |\n\n**Total Expense Reduction Beyond RUBS: -$1,500/year NOI increase** (from management/admin optimization)\n\nOn a 4-unit property, you're not getting economies of scale for vendor contracts or staffing efficiency.\n\n---\n\n### **D. OTHER INCOME OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n**Pet Rent:**\n- $50/month per pet\n- Assume 50% of units allow pets = 2 units\n- **Annual income: $1,200**\n\n**Parking/Storage:**\n- If there are extra parking spaces: $50-75/month each\n- Assume 1 extra space rentable\n- **Annual income: $600**\n\n**Turnover Fees:**\n- $200 cleaning/inspection fee per move-out\n- Assume 25% annual turnover = 1 unit\n- **Annual income: $200**\n\n**Application Fees:**\n- $50 per application × 3 unsuccessful applications/year\n- **Annual income: $150**\n\n**Late Fees:**\n- $75 per occurrence × 2/year average\n- **Annual income: $150**\n\n**Total Other Income: +$2,300/year**\n\n---\n\n### **E. TOTAL VALUE-ADD SUMMARY**\n\n| Value-Add Strategy | Year 1 NOI Impact |\n|-------------------|------------------|\n| Rent to Market | $0 (already at market ceiling) |\n| Rent Growth (3% inflation) | +$4,891 |\n| RUBS Implementation | +$5,000 |\n| Expense Optimization | +$1,500 |\n| Other Income | +$2,300 |\n| **TOTAL YEAR 1 NOI INCREASE** | **+$13,691** |\n\n**Stabilized Year 1 NOI:** $114,751 + $13,691 = **$128,442**\n\n---\n\n### **Stabilized Value Calculation**\n\n**Exit Cap Rate Assumption:** 4.75% \n\n(Adding 0.50% to today's actual 4.25% cap to account for rate normalization and Phoenix market risk)\n\n**Stabilized Value:** $128,442 / 0.0475 = **$2,704,042**\n\n**Value Creation:** $2,704,042 - $2,700,000 = **$4,042** (0.15%)\n\n**Translation: This is essentially ZERO meaningful value-add** because:\n1. Rents are already at market ceiling\n2. Property is brand new (no forced appreciation via renovation/repositioning)\n3. Phoenix multifamily market is soft (oversupplied, no demand tailwind)\n4. Most \"value-add\" is just implementing normal operating procedures that should already be in place\n\n**You're buying a stabilized, fully-priced asset with no real upside runway. This is not a value-add deal — it's a core-plus deal priced like core.**\n\n---\n\n## 4. CREATIVE STRUCTURE A — SELLER CARRY ON DOWN PAYMENT\n\n**Structure Overview:**\n- **Bank Senior Loan:** 75% LTV = $2,025,000 at 7.0%, 30-year amortization\n- **Seller Second Lien:** 20% of price = $540,000 at 5.0% interest-only, 60-month balloon\n- **Real's Cash Down:** 5% of price = $135,000\n\n**Total Capital Stack:**\n- Bank: $2,025,000 (75%)\n- Seller Note: $540,000 (20%)\n- Real's Cash: $135,000 (5%)\n- **Total:** $2,700,000 ✓\n\n---\n\n### **Debt Service Calculation:**\n\n**Bank Loan:**\n- Amount: $2,025,000\n- Rate: 7.0%\n- Term: 30 years amortizing\n- Monthly Payment: $13,467\n- **Annual Debt Service: $161,604**\n\n**Seller Note:**\n- Amount: $540,000\n- Rate: 5.0% interest-only\n- Monthly Payment: $540,000 × 0.05 / 12 = $2,250\n- **Annual Debt Service: $27,000**\n\n**Combined Annual Debt Service:** $161,604 + $27,000 = **$188,604**\n\n---\n\n### **DSCR with Seller Carry:**\n\n**Using Realistic Day-One NOI ($114,751):**\n\nDSCR = $114,751 / $188,604 = **0.608** ❌\n\n**Using Stabilized Year 1 NOI ($128,442):**\n\nDSCR = $128,442 / $188,604 = **0.681** ❌\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Structure Has a Critical Problem:**\n\n**Banks calculate DSCR on TOTAL debt service, not just their loan.**\n\nWhen you apply for the senior loan, the bank sees:\n- NOI: $114,751\n- Total debt obligations (their loan + seller note): $188,604\n- DSCR: 0.608\n\n**They will NOT approve the senior loan because DSCR is far below 1.25 minimum.**\n\nThe bank doesn't care that the seller is willing to carry — they only care that the property generates enough income to cover ALL debt obligations with cushion.\n\n**Adding seller carry makes the DSCR WORSE, not better, because you're adding more debt service against the same NOI.**\n\nSome banks will subordinate seller carry and only calculate DSCR on their loan, but they'll require:\n- Standstill agreements (seller can't foreclose for X years)\n- Seller note terms approved by bank\n- Higher down payment from you (10-15% instead of 5%)\n\n**For this analysis, we'll assume you find a lender willing to subordinate the seller note and calculate DSCR only on their loan ($2,025,000):**\n\nDSCR on bank loan only = $114,751 / $161,604 = **0.710** ❌\n\nStill below 1.25. Still a problem. You'd likely need 30-35% total down payment (bank + cash) to make DSCR work.\n\n---\n\n### **Day-One Monthly Cashflow with Seller Carry:**\n\n- **Monthly NOI:** $9,563\n- **Bank Debt Service:** -$13,467\n- **Seller Debt Service:** -$2,250\n- **Net Monthly Cashflow:** **-$6,154** ❌\n\n**Annual Cashflow:** **-$73,853** ❌\n\n**You'd lose $6,154 every single month. That's worse than the straight 75% LTV structure.**\n\n---\n\n### **Real's Cash Investment:**\n\n- Down Payment (5%): $135,000\n- Closing Costs (3%): $81,000\n- **Total Cash In:** $216,000\n\n**Cash-on-Cash Return:** -$73,853 / $216,000 = **-34.2%** ❌\n\n**You're losing 34% of your invested capital annually.**\n\n---\n\n### **The Seller Note Balloon Problem:**\n\nIn Year 5, you owe the seller $540,000 in full.\n\nTo pay this, you need to either:\n1. **Refinance** and cash out $540K\n2. **Sell** the property\n\n**Can you refi out the seller note in Year 5?**\n\nUsing Stabilized NOI from Section 3 with 3% annual rent growth compounding:\n\n**Year 5 Projected NOI:**\n- Year 1: $128,442\n- Year 2: $132,295 (+3%)\n- Year 3: $136,264 (+3%)\n- Year 4: $140,352 (+3%)\n- Year 5: **$144,562**\n\n**Stabilized Value at Year 5 (5.0% exit cap):**\n\n$144,562 / 0.05 = **$2,891,240**\n\n**Refinance at 70% LTV:**\n- New Loan: $2,891,240 × 0.70 = **$2,023,868**\n- Payoff Original Bank Loan: ~$1,920,000 (remaining principal after 60 payments)\n- Payoff Seller Note: **$540,000**\n- **Total Payoffs:** $2,460,000\n\n**Cash Out from Refi:** $2,023,868 - $1,920,000 = **$103,868**\n\n**Seller Note Owed:** $540,000\n\n**Shortfall:** $540,000 - $103,868 = **-$436,132** ❌\n\n**You're $436K short of paying off the seller note. You'd need to bring cash to the table or negotiate an extension (good luck with that).**\n\n---\n\n### **Does Structure A Work?**\n\n**NO. Absolutely not.**\n\nProblems:\n1. **Bank likely won't approve** the senior loan with combined DSCR of 0.608\n2. **Negative cashflow of $6,154/month** — you'd burn through your $216K equity in 35 months\n3. **Seller balloon payment in Year 5** — you can't refi out of it without bringing $436K cash\n4. **You lose money every month** for 5 years while praying for appreciation\n\n**Seller carry doesn't fix fundamentally broken economics. It makes them worse by adding more debt service to already insufficient NOI.**\n\n**This structure is a financial suicide mission.**\n\n---\n\n## 5. CREATIVE STRUCTURE B — EQUITY PARTNER FUNDS DOWN PAYMENT\n\n**Structure Overview:**\n- **Bank Senior Loan:** 75% LTV = $2,025,000 at 7.0%, 30-year amortization\n- **Equity Partner:** Contributes 95% of down payment = $641,250\n- **Real's Contribution:** 5% of down payment = $33,750 (1.25% of purchase price)\n- **Partner Terms:** 8% annual preferred return on $641,250 = **$51,300/year**\n\n**Total Capital Stack:**\n- Bank Loan: $2,025,000 (75%)\n- Partner Equity: $641,250 (23.75%)\n- Real's Equity: $33,750 (1.25%)\n- **Total:** $2,700,000 ✓\n\n---\n\n### **Annual Cash Obligations:**\n\n- Bank Debt Service: $161,604\n- Partner Preferred Return: $51,300\n- **Total Annual Obligations:** $212,904\n\n---\n\n### **Cashflow Analysis:**\n\n**Day-One (Realistic NOI = $114,751):**\n\n- NOI: $114,751\n- Less: Bank Debt Service: -$161,604\n- **Shortfall BEFORE Partner Pref:** **-$46,853** ❌\n\nThere's literally NO money to pay the partner their 8% preferred return.\n\n**Net Cashflow to Real:** **-$98,153/year** ❌\n**Monthly to Real:** **-$8,179** ❌\n\n---\n\n**Stabilized Year 1 (NOI = $128,442 after value-add):**\n\n- NOI: $128,442\n- Less: Bank Debt Service: -$161,604\n- **Shortfall BEFORE Partner Pref:** **-$33,162** ❌\n\nStill negative before paying partner.\n\n**Net Cashflow to Real:** **-$84,462/year** ❌\n**Monthly to Real:** **-$7,039** ❌\n\n---\n\n### **Does Real Have Positive Cashflow After Paying Partner Pref?**\n\n**No. Not even fucking close.**\n\nEven with ALL value-add executed perfectly in Year 1, you're still losing $7,039/month.\n\n**The partner isn't getting paid their preferred return either.** The property generates $128,442 NOI but owes $161,604 in bank debt service alone, leaving -$33,162 BEFORE any partner distribution.\n\n**There is ZERO cashflow available to pay the partner their 8% preferred return.**\n\n---\n\n### **What Would a Rational Equity Partner Say?**\n\n*\"You want me to invest $641,250 into a property that:*\n- *Loses $7,000/month even after all value-add*\n- *Can't pay me my 8% preferred return*\n- *Has negative cashflow from day one*\n- *Requires me to potentially fund operating losses*\n- *While hoping Phoenix appreciates enough to bail us out*\n\n*Get the fuck out of my office.\"*\n\n**No rational equity partner takes this deal. Zero.**\n\n---\n\n### **Refi Buyout Math (Year 5):**\n\nLet's be EXTREMELY generous and assume:\n- You execute all value-add successfully\n- You survive 5 years of negative cashflow\n- Phoenix doesn't crash\n- You get 3% rent growth annually\n\n**Year 5 NOI Projection:**\n\nStarting from Stabilized Year 1 NOI of $128,442:\n- Year 2: $132,295 (+3%)\n- Year 3: $136,264 (+3%)\n- Year 4: $140,352 (+3%)\n- Year 5: **$144,562**\n\n---\n\n**Stabilized Value at Year 5 (5.0% exit cap):**\n\nAdding 0.75% to today's 4.25% cap for rate normalization:\n\n**Year 5 Value:** $144,562 / 0.05 = **$2,891,240**\n\n**Appreciation:** $191,240 (7.1% total over 5 years = 1.4% annually)\n\n---\n\n**Refinance at 70% LTV:**\n\n- **New Loan:** $2,891,240 × 0.70 = $2,023,868\n- **Payoff Original Bank Loan:** ~$1,920,000 (remaining principal)\n- **Net Cash Proceeds:** $103,868\n\n---\n\n**Partner Buyout Calculation:**\n\nPartner invested: $641,250\nPreferred return: 8% × 5 years = 40% accrued\n**Total Partner Owed (principal + accrued pref):** $641,250 × 1.40 = **$897,750**\n\n**Cash from refi:** $103,868\n\n**Shortfall to buyout partner:** $897,750 - $103,868 = **-$793,882** ❌\n\n---\n\n**Can You Buyout the Partner with Refi Proceeds?**\n\n**Not even fucking close.**\n\nYou're **$793,882 SHORT** of paying back the partner their principal plus accrued preferred return.\n\nThe property would need to be worth **$4,026,763** to generate enough refi proceeds. That's 49% appreciation in 5 years in Phoenix's overbuilt multifamily market.\n\n**Not happening.**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Exit: Sell in Year 5**\n\n**Sale Proceeds:**\n- Sale Price: $2,891,240\n- Less: Selling Costs (6%): -$173,474\n- Less: Bank Loan Payoff: -$1,920,000\n- **Net Proceeds:** $797,766\n\n**Pay the Partner:**\n- Partner Owed (principal + accrued pref): $897,750\n- **Shortfall:** **-$99,984** ❌\n\n**Even if you SELL the property, you don't have enough proceeds to fully pay the partner what they're contractually owed.**\n\n**And Real gets ZERO. Actually worse than zero — Real gets to fund $7,039/month in losses for 5 years.**\n\n---\n\n### **Does Structure B Work?**\n\n**Absolutely fucking not. This is possibly worse than Structure A.**\n\nProblems:\n1. **Partner doesn't get paid 8% pref** — deal loses money from day one\n2. **Partner CAN'T be bought out at refi** — proceeds are $793K short\n3. **Partner CAN'T be fully paid at sale** — still $100K short\n4. **Real gets NOTHING at exit** — not even equity participation\n5. **Both parties lose money** over 5 years\n\n**The only way this structure \"works\" is if:**\n- Phoenix appreciates 40-50% in 5 years (unlikely)\n- Partner is your dad and doesn't care about returns (not investing, charity)\n- You enjoy losing money while working hard (masochism)\n\n**This structure is mathematically impossible with these property economics.**\n\n---\n\n## 6. REFI / EXIT ANALYSIS\n\nLet's assume you somehow bought this with conventional 75% LTV financing (25% down = $675K) and held for 5 years.\n\n---\n\n### **Year 5 Stabilized Financials:**\n\nStarting from Day-One Realistic NOI: $114,751\n\n**Year 1 Stabilized (after value-add execution):**\n- Base NOI: $114,751\n- Add: RUBS: +$5,000\n- Add: Other income: +$2,300\n- Add: Expense optimization: +$1,500\n- Add: Rent growth (3%): +$4,891\n- **Year 1 Stabilized NOI:** $128,442\n\n**Years 2-5 Compounding Rent Growth (3% annually):**\n- Year 2: $132,295\n- Year 3: $136,264\n- Year 4: $140,352\n- Year 5: **$144,562**\n\n---\n\n### **Year 5 Stabilized Value:**\n\n**Exit Cap Rate:** 5.0% (adding 0.75% to today's actual 4.25% cap for rate normalization and market risk)\n\n**Year 5 Value:** $144,562 / 0.05 = **$2,891,240**\n\n**Total Appreciation:** $191,240 (7.1% over 5 years = 1.4% annually)\n\nThis assumes everything goes perfectly and Phoenix doesn't oversupply further.\n\n---\n\n### **Refinance Scenario (75% LTV):**\n\n**New Loan Amount:** $2,891,240 × 0.75 = **$2,168,430**\n\n**New Loan Terms:**",
