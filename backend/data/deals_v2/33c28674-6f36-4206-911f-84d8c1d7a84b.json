      "analysis": "## 1. DEAL SNAPSHOT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n- Purchase price: $2,700,000  \n- Current NOI: $141,597  \n- Pro forma NOI: Missing  \n- Current cap rate: 5.25%  \n- Stabilized cap rate: Missing  \n- Expense ratio: Missing  \n- Price per unit: $675,000  \n- Price per SF: $457.63  \n\nThis property is priced hot. The price per unit is exceptionally high for a 4-unit multifamily property, which raises red flags about potential overvaluation or broker inflation. The absence of pro forma and stabilized cap rates is concerning as it prevents a thorough assessment of future performance.\n\n## 2. DAY-ONE FINANCIALS (Based on calc_json)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n- Year 1 NOI: Missing  \n- Total debt service: Missing  \n- Cashflow: Missing  \n- DSCR: Missing  \n\nSeveral crucial numbers are missing that are essential for evaluating the financial viability of this deal. Without the DSCR, it's impossible to assess whether there's sufficient cash flow to cover debt obligations. This is a major red flag.\n\n## 3. SELECTED DEAL STRUCTURE (wizard_structure)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n**Financing Strategy: Not specified in the wizard**  \n- Bank loan amount: Missing  \n- Seller note amount: Missing  \n- Interest rate(s): Missing  \n- IO or amortization: Missing  \n- Balloon: Missing  \n- Real's cash in: Missing  \n- DSCR using this structure: Missing  \n- Cashflow day one: Missing  \n\nWithout a defined financing strategy or any concrete financing numbers, it's impossible to evaluate the viability of the structure. This lack of clarity is a significant issue.\n\n## 4. VALUE-ADD / NOI ENGINEERING (use deal_json + calc_json)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n- Rent upside from unit mix: Current rents for 1 Bed units at $2,400 and 3 Bed units at $4,750 appear to be at market rates considering the property class and location. However, without market comparisons, it's difficult to gauge true upside.  \n- Loss-to-lease: Missing  \n- RUBS or utility billback opportunity: Missing  \n- Expense normalization: The operating expenses total $26,223, which needs further analysis against industry standards for a property of this size.  \n- Other income opportunities: Missing  \n\nOverall, the potential for value-add appears limited given the current rents and lack of other income opportunities documented here.\n\n## 5. REFI ANALYSIS (calc_json.refi)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRefi analysis numbers are missing. Therefore, I cannot assess:\n- Whether a partner can be bought out  \n- If a seller note can be paid off  \n- The meaningfulness of cash-out  \n- The risk associated with the refi  \n\n## 6. RISK SUMMARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n- Missing key financial metrics such as Year 1 NOI, total debt service, and DSCR make this deal highly risky.  \n- The absence of a defined financing structure adds to the uncertainty.  \n- The high price per unit raises questions about valuation and future cash flows.  \n- Lack of clarity on market rents and expenses creates further risk.  \n- No exit strategy or refi analysis provided adds to the overall risk profile of the deal.  \n\n## 7. BUY BOX TEST (if buy_box provided)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nNo buy box supplied — applying conservative underwriting standards.\n\n## 8. VERDICT (MANDATORY)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n🔴 PASS  \nPASS because the entire deal depends on missing critical financial metrics and lacks a defined structure to evaluate its viability.",
