This could generate additional income.\n   - **Storage Units:** If space allows, create storage units for tenants.\n   - **Pet Fees:** If pets are allowed, introduce pet rent or one-time pet fees.\n   - **Additional Income Estimate:** Assuming $100/month for laundry and storage combined = $100 * 12 months * 4 units = **$4,800/year**.\n\n#### 4. **Expense Optimization**\n   - **Review Each Expense Category:** Analyze the $26,223 in expenses thoroughly. Look for areas to cut or renegotiate:\n     - **Management Fees:** If high, consider self-management or negotiating lower fees.\n     - **Utilities:** Implement energy-efficient solutions to reduce utility costs.\n     - **Repairs & Maintenance:** Ensure these are not inflated; maintain a reserve for unexpected repairs.\n   - **Potential Savings Estimate:** If you can reduce expenses by 10%, that’s a savings of **$2,622.30/year**.\n\n### Summary of Value-Add Recommendations\n1. **Adjust Rents:** Align rents with market; if tenants are willing to pay current rates, ensure lease agreements are structured to maintain those rates.\n2. **Implement RUBS:** Generate additional income through utility bill-backs.\n3. **Introduce Additional Income Streams:** Laundry facilities, storage, and pet fees can provide significant cash flow.\n4. **Optimize Operating Expenses:** Conduct a thorough audit of all expenses to identify savings.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nBy implementing these strategies, you could potentially increase your NOI significantly:\n- From additional income sources: **$7,200/year** (RUBS + other income).\n- From expense savings: **$2,622.30/year**.\n- **Total Potential NOI Increase:** **$9,822.30/year**.\n\nThis increase in NOI will enhance the property value significantly when applying a realistic cap rate for valuation. If you can push your NOI from $30,977 to around **$40,799.30**, you'll see a marked increase in property value.\n\nLet me know if you need further calculations or additional strategies!"
