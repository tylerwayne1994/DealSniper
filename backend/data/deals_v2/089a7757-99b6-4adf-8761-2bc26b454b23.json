BASE METRICS\n\n**Property Summary:**\n- **Price:** $2,700,000\n- **Price/Unit:** $675,000 (fucking astronomical for 4 units)\n- **Price/SF:** $457.63\n- **Units:** 4 total (2x 1bd/1ba @ 850sf, 2x 3bd/2ba @ 2,110sf)\n- **Year Built:** 2024 (brand new construction)\n- **Current NOI:** $141,597\n- **Current Occupancy:** Assumed 95% (5% vacancy modeled)\n- **Average Current Rent:** $3,575/unit/month ($2,400 for 1bd, $4,750 for 3bd)\n\n**Capitalization Analysis:**\n- **As-Is Cap Rate:** 5.25% ($141,597 NOI / $2,700,000)\n- **Market Context:** This is typical for new construction in hot Phoenix submarkets, but it's priced like Class A product in a premium location.\n\n**Expense Ratio:** 15.6% ($26,223 / $167,820 EGI) — **RED FLAG WARNING**\n\nThis expense ratio is dangerously low and unrealistic. Let me show you what's bullshit here:\n\n**Broker's Expenses (Annual):**\n- Taxes: $3,211\n- Insurance: $1,700\n- Utilities: $6,400\n- Repairs/Maintenance: $4,400\n- Management: $6,712\n- Admin: $2,050\n- Marketing: $750\n- Other: $1,000\n- **Total: $26,223 ($6,556/unit/year)**\n\n**Reality Check - What Expenses SHOULD Be:**\n- Taxes: $3,211 (likely accurate for new construction)\n- Insurance: $3,500 (2024 Arizona market is brutal, not $1,700)\n- Utilities: $6,400 (could be accurate if all separately metered)\n- Repairs/Maintenance: $8,000 (new construction helps, but use $2,000/unit minimum)\n- Management: $10,000 (6% of gross rent is standard, not 4%)\n- Admin: $2,050 (acceptable)\n- Marketing: $1,500 (double it for reality)\n- Reserves: $4,000 (completely missing - $1,000/unit minimum)\n- Other: $2,000\n- **REALISTIC TOTAL: $40,661 ($10,165/unit/year)**\n\n**Adjusted NOI Using Real Expenses:** $167,820 - $40,661 = **$127,159**\n\n**Actual As-Is Cap Rate:** 4.71% ($127,159 / $2,700,000)\n\n**TRANSLATION:** This is priced at aggressive new construction pricing with fantasy expenses. The 5.25% cap is actually 4.7% when you stop lying to yourself.\n\n---\n\n## 2. STRUCTURE A — SELLER CARRIES THE DOWN PAYMENT\n\n**Deal Structure:**\n- **Purchase Price:** $2,700,000\n- **Senior Bank Loan (70% LTV):** $1,890,000\n- **Seller Carry (30% of price):** $810,000\n- **USER Cash In (5% of down payment):** $40,500\n\n**Financing Terms:**\n- **Bank Loan:** $1,890,000 @ 7.25%, 30-year amortization\n  - Monthly Debt Service: $12,895\n  - Annual Debt Service: $154,735\n  \n- **Seller Carry:** $810,000 @ 5.5% interest-only for 60 months\n  - Monthly Debt Service: $3,713\n  - Annual Debt Service: $44,550\n\n- **Total Annual Debt Service:** $199,285\n\n**DSCR Analysis:**\n\n**Bank Debt Only (What Lender Sees):**\n- Current NOI: $141,597 / $154,735 = **0.92 DSCR** ❌\n- Adjusted NOI: $127,159 / $154,735 = **0.82 DSCR** ❌❌\n\n**Combined Debt (Reality Check):**\n- Current NOI: $141,597 / $199,285 = **0.71 DSCR** 💀\n- Adjusted NOI: $127,159 / $199,285 = **0.64 DSCR** 💀💀\n\n**Cashflow Analysis:**\n\n| Metric | Using Broker NOI | Using Real NOI |\n|--------|------------------|----------------|\n| NOI | $141,597 | $127,159 |\n| Bank Debt Service | ($154,735) | ($154,735) |\n| Seller Carry Debt | ($44,550) | ($44,550) |\n| **Net Cashflow** | **($57,688)** | **($72,126)** |\n| Monthly Burn Rate | ($4,807) | ($6,011) |\n\n**YOUR ACTUAL CASH-ON-CASH:** \n- Investment: $40,500\n- Annual Cashflow: -$72,126\n- CoC Return: **-178.1%** 🔥🔥🔥\n\n**STRUCTURE A VERDICT:** This doesn't \"work\" — it fucking implodes. You're bleeding $6,000/month with realistic expenses. No bank is lending at 0.82 DSCR. Even using the broker's fantasy numbers, you're underwater $58k/year. And in 60 months, you owe the seller $810,000 in a balloon payment you'll never have.\n\n---\n\n## 3. STRUCTURE B — EQUITY PARTNER FUNDS DOWN PAYMENT\n\n**Deal Structure:**\n- **Purchase Price:** $2,700,000\n- **Senior Bank Loan (70% LTV):** $1,890,000\n- **Total Equity Required:** $810,000\n- **Equity Partner (95%):** $769,500\n- **USER (5% - GP/Operator):** $40,500\n\n**Financing Terms:**\n- **Bank Loan:** $1,890,000 @ 7.25%, 30-year amortization\n  - Annual Debt Service: $154,735\n  \n- **Partner Preferred Return:** 8% on $769,500 = $61,560/year\n\n**Cashflow Waterfall:**\n\n| Item | Using Broker NOI | Using Real NOI |\n|------|------------------|----------------|\n| NOI | $141,597 | $127,159 |\n| Bank Debt Service | ($154,735) | ($154,735) |\n| Partner Pref (8%) | ($61,560) | ($61,560) |\n| **Net to USER** | **($74,698)** | **($89,136)** |\n\n**USER Effective Return:**\n- Investment: $40,500\n- Annual Cashflow: -$89,136\n- **Cash-on-Cash: -220%** 💀💀💀\n\n**Partner Position:**\n- Investment: $769,500\n- Preferred Return Due: $61,560\n- Actual Payment Received: $0 (insufficient cashflow)\n- **Partner's Actual Return: 0%** (they get nothing while their money dies)\n\n**STRUCTURE B VERDICT:** Even worse than Structure A. You can't pay the bank OR the partner. Any partner who takes this deal deserves to lose their money for not underwriting properly. You'd burn through $89k/year while explaining to your partner why they're getting nothing and you need MORE capital calls to survive.\n\n---\n\n## 4. REFI / EXIT ANALYSIS (STABILIZED VALUE)\n\nLet's be generous and assume you can somehow survive the negative cashflow long enough to explore an exit. Here's the fantasy:\n\n**Stabilized Assumptions:**\n- Keep current rents (already at $2,400 and $4,750 — these are market)\n- Maintain 95% occupancy\n- **Stabilized NOI (Real Expenses):** $127,159\n- **Exit Cap Rate:** 5.25% (assuming market stays hot)\n\n**Stabilized Value Calculation:**\n$127,159 / 0.0525 = **$2,421,314**\n\n**You just lost $278,686 in value by using real expenses.**\n\n**Refi Analysis (70% LTV):**\n- Refi Loan Amount: $1,694,920\n- Payoff Original Bank Loan: ~$1,850,000 (approximately after 3 years of minimal principal paydown)\n- **Net Proceeds:** -$155,080 ❌\n\n**TRANSLATION:** You can't even refi out of the original debt, let alone pay back the seller carry or equity partner.\n\n**Alternative Exit — Sale at Year 3:**\n\n**Structure A Sale:**\n- Sale Price: $2,421,314\n- Less: Selling Costs (3%): $72,639\n- Net Proceeds: $2,348,675\n- Less: Bank Loan Payoff: $1,850,000\n- Less: Seller Carry Balloon: $810,000\n- **Net to USER:** -$311,325 ❌❌\n\n**You'd need to write a $311k check to exit the deal.**\n\n**Structure B Sale:**\n- Net After Debt: $2,348,675 - $1,850,000 = $498,675\n- Partner needs their $769,500 back\n- **Shortfall:** -$270,825 ❌❌\n\n**Plus you've been funding losses:**\n- Structure A: 3 years x $72,126/year = $216,378 in cash burned\n- Structure B: 3 years x $89,136/year = $267,408 in cash burned\n\n**TOTAL LOSS SCENARIOS:**\n\n**Structure A (3-year hold):**\n- Operating losses funded: $216,378\n- Exit shortfall: $311,325\n- **Total loss: $527,703** 🔥\n\n**Structure B (3-year hold):**\n- Operating losses funded: $267,408\n- Partner shortfall: $270,825\n- **Total loss: $538,233** 🔥\n\n**REFI/EXIT VERDICT:** There is no winning exit scenario unless Phoenix goes absolutely nuclear and you can sell at a 4.0% cap or lower (meaning property values rise 30%+). You're basically betting on the greater fool theory with a half-million-dollar downside.\n\n---\n\n## 5. RISKS / RED FLAGS\n\n**DEAL-KILLING ISSUES:**\n\n1. **Fantasy Expense Underwriting** \n   - $6,556/unit is 40% below realistic multifamily expenses\n   - Insurance alone is probably double what's shown ($1,700 vs $3,500)\n   - Zero reserves budgeted (rookie mistake or intentional fraud)\n   - Management at 4% instead of industry standard 6%\n\n2. **Negative Cashflow Day One**\n   - Deal loses $6,000+/month from day one with realistic expenses\n   - Requires constant capital calls to survive\n   - No margin for ANY vacancy beyond the 5% modeled\n   - One vacancy = $8,000+/month burn rate\n\n3. **No Bank Will Lend This**\n   - 0.82 DSCR is an automatic rejection from any competent lender\n   - Even at fantasy expenses (0.92), you're below 1.0x minimum\n   - Would need to bring $400k+ more equity to get to 1.25x DSCR\n   - Or seller would need to carry 50%+ (they won't)\n\n4. **Insane Price Per Unit**\n   - $675,000/unit in Phoenix is mansion pricing\n   - Even brand new, this is 40-50% above market for small multifamily\n   - Comparable 4-plexes in Phoenix trading at $400-500k/unit\n   - You're paying a 50% \"stupid tax\" for this property\n\n5. **Zero Value-Add Runway**\n   - Already at market rents ($2,400 for 1bd and $4,750 for 3bd are solid Phoenix rents)\n   - Brand new (2024), so no repositioning play\n   - Can't add units on 0 acres of land (suspicious data)\n   - The ONLY play here is appreciation, which is gambling, not investing\n\n6. **Small Deal, Big Problems**\n   - 4 units means 25% vacancy from ONE unit turning\n   - One bad tenant = entire cashflow destroyed\n   - Management and operations costs don't scale at 4 units\n   - Fixed costs kill you on small properties\n\n7. **Market Timing Risk**\n   - Phoenix appreciation slowing significantly (2023-2024 plateau)\n   - Interest rates making debt service brutal (7.25% is painful)\n   - New construction supply flooding market = rent pressure\n   - Multifamily fundamentals softening across Phoenix metro\n\n8. **Lender/Partner Risk**\n   - Structure A: No bank approves 0.82 DSCR, seller carry balloon = forced sale\n   - Structure B: Partner lawsuit when you can't pay 8% pref\n   - Both structures require explaining why you need more money every month\n\n9. **Missing Data Red Flags**\n   - Property class not specified (is this even legal/permitted?)\n   - No parking spaces listed (how does a 4-unit property have zero parking?)\n   - Land area shows \"0 acres\" (data error or condo? If condo, HOA fees missing)\n   - No market rent comps provided (hiding something?)\n   - No detail on unit finishes, location quality, or neighborhood\n\n10. **Catastrophic Balloon Payment Risk (Structure A)**\n    - $810,000 due in 60 months\n    - You'll have burned $360k in losses by then\n    - Property worth $300k LESS than you paid\n    - No refi possible at those numbers\n    - Foreclosure or bankruptcy is the exit\n\n---\n\n## 6. VALUE-ADD OPPORTUNITIES\n\n**Let me be blunt: There are essentially NONE.**\n\n❌ **Rent Growth:** Already at market. 1bd @ $2,400 and 3bd @ $4,750 are solid Phoenix rents for new construction. Maybe 3-4%/year organic growth, which doesn't move the needle.\n\n❌ **Unit Add:** Zero land (0 acres listed). No room for ADUs or additional units. Even if land exists, permitting and construction costs would exceed returns.\n\n❌ **Interior Upgrades:** Built in 2024. Already has new everything. Stainless appliances, granite/quartz counters, modern finishes. Nothing to upgrade.\n\n❌ **Amenities:** 4-unit property. Can't add pool, gym, or meaningful amenities that would justify rent increases.\n\n❌ **Expense Reduction:** Already underwritten at fantasy-low expenses ($6,556/unit). Only direction is UP to realistic market expenses ($10,165/unit).\n\n❌ **Laundry Income:** Too small to matter, likely already included in \"other income\" ($4,800/year).\n\n❌ **Parking Revenue:** Zero parking spaces listed. Probably already included or physically impossible.\n\n❌ **Storage:** Not enough scale to make any meaningful income. Maybe $25/unit/month = $1,200/year. Doesn't move DSCR.\n\n❌ **Utility Billing:** If not already separately metered (likely is given $6,400 utility expense), savings would be minimal on 4 units.\n\n❌ **Refinance to Lower Rate:** You can't refi when you're underwater and have negative DSCR. Rates would need to drop to 4% to make this work (not happening).\n\n**The ONLY \"value-add\" play here is praying Phoenix rents grow 20-25% over 3 years to make the numbers work. That's called gambling, not underwriting.**\n\n**What you'd NEED to make this work:**\n- Rents to jump to $3,000/1bd and $5,900/3bd (24% increase)\n- That gets you to $206k gross income\n- At 95% occupancy and realistic expenses = $154k NOI\n- That's a 5.7% cap on your $2.7M purchase\n- DSCR would be 1.0x (barely acceptable)\n- **You'd still have negative cashflow of $45k/year with Structure A**\n\n**VERDICT ON VALUE-ADD:** None exists. This is a \"buy and pray\" deal.\n\n---\n\n## 7. ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS\n\nLet's see what it would take to make this deal actually work:\n\n**What Price Makes This Deal Work?**\n\nWorking backwards from a 1.25 DSCR requirement:\n- Realistic NOI: $127,159\n- Bank loan at 7.25%, 30yr amort needs max $101,727 annual debt service\n- That supports a loan of ~$1,486,000\n- At 70% LTV, that's a purchase price of **$2,123,000**\n\n**You're overpaying by $577,000 (27% too high).**\n\n**What Down Payment Makes This Work at $2.7M?**\n\nTo hit 1.25 DSCR with $127k NOI:\n- Max annual debt service: $101,727\n- That supports loan of $1,486,000\n- Required down payment: $1,214,000 (45% down)\n- **You'd need to put down $1.2M to make the bank comfortable**\n\n**What Rent Growth Makes This Work?**\n\nTo generate enough NOI for 1.25 DSCR:\n- Need $193k NOI ($155k debt service x 1.25)\n- Currently at $127k NOI\n- Need $66k more NOI (52% increase)\n- That means rents need to jump from $3,575/unit to $5,375/unit average\n- **1bd would need to rent for $3,600, 3bd for $7,150**\n- **This is delusional for Phoenix**\n\n**TRADITIONAL 25% DOWN ANALYSIS:**\n\nIf you brought $675k cash (25% down):\n- Loan: $2,025,000 @ 7.25%\n- Annual debt service: $138,112\n- DSCR: $127,159 / $138,112 = **0.92x** ❌\n- Annual cashflow: $127,159 - $138,112 = **-$10,953**\n- Cash-on-cash: **-1.6%**\n\n**Even with massive down payment, you're still losing money.**\n\n---\n\n## 8. FINAL VERDICT: 🔴 PASS\n\n**PASS because this deal is financial suicide disguised as new construction.**\n\nHere's what's actually happening: Some developer built this in 2024, realized they overpaid for land and overbuilt for the market, and is now trying to dump it on a retail buyer using fraudulent expense underwriting. The $6,556/unit expense assumption is either incompetence or malice.\n\n**The math is simple:**\n- You need $2.7M to buy\n- It generates $127k NOI (reality)\n- At 7.25% debt, you need $2.12M or less purchase price to hit 1.25 DSCR\n- **You're overpaying by $577,000**\n\n**What the seller is counting on:**\n- You seeing \"2024 construction\" and getting excited\n- You not questioning the fantasy expenses\n- You believing Phoenix appreciation will save you\n- You having deep enough pockets to fund $6k+/month losses for 3-5 years\n\n**What actually happens:**\n\n**STRUCTURE A DEATH SPIRAL:**\n- Month 1-12: Burn $72k funding negative cashflow\n- Month 13-24: Burn another $72k, total losses = $144k\n- Month 25-36: Burn another $72k, total losses = $216k\n- Month 37-48: Burn another $72k, total losses = $288k\n- Month 49-60: Burn another $72k, total losses = $360k\n- Month 60: Balloon payment of $810k due, property worth $2.4M, you're underwater\n- **Total capital required: $1,170,000 ($40k initial + $360k losses + $770k shortfall)**\n\n**STRUCTURE B DEATH SPIRAL:**\n- Same burn rate but higher ($89k/year)\n- Partner gets zero returns while watching their money die\n- After 3 years, you've burned $267k\n- Property worth less than purchase price\n- Partner wants out, sues you for $770k + legal fees\n- **Reputation destroyed, partnership over, potential bankruptcy**\n\n**Why this isn't a MAYBE:**\n\nSome deals are creative financing opportunities. This is not one of them. Creative financing doesn't fix a property that's $577,000 overpriced with fantasy expenses. The ONLY way this works is:\n\n1. Price drops to $2,100,000, OR\n2. Rents jump 50% (not happening), OR\n3. Interest rates drop to 3% (not happening), OR\n4. You're okay burning $500k+ over 5 years for \"experience\"\n\n**This isn't a MAYBE because there's no scenario where creative financing saves you. It's just lipstick on a pig.**\n\n**THIS IS A PASS BECAUSE:**\n- 0.82 DSCR = no lender approval\n- -$72k/year cashflow = capital call hell\n- $675k/unit = 50% overpayment\n- No value-add = no upside\n- Exit underwater = no escape\n- Total capital required exceeds $1M+ over life of deal\n\n**PASS. Walk away. Don't look back. Find a deal where the numbers actually work instead of hoping Phoenix turns into Manhattan and your expenses stay in fantasy land.**\n\n---\n\n**ONE SENTENCE VERDICT:** PASS because you'd burn through $500k+ over 5 years on a property that's worth $577k less than asking, with no lender willing to finance it, no value-add to execute, and no exit that doesn't require writing a massive check or declaring bankruptcy.",

For both structures, I will analyze their cash flow impacts and whether they could make this deal viable.\n\n### 1. Seller Carry Structure with 6-Month IO Period\n\n**Deal Structure:**\n- **Purchase Price:** $2,700,000\n- **Senior Bank Loan (70% LTV):** $1,890,000\n- **Seller Carry (30% of price):** $810,000\n\n**Financing Terms:**\n- **Bank Loan:** $1,890,000 @ 7.25%, 30-year amortization\n  - **Monthly Debt Service:** $12,895\n  - **Annual Debt Service:** $154,735\n- **Seller Carry:** $810,000 @ 5.5% interest-only for 6 months\n  - **Monthly Debt Service:** $3,713\n  - **Annual Debt Service for 6 months:** $22,278\n- **Total Debt Service for 6 months:** $154,735 + $22,278 = $177,013\n\n**Day-One Cash Flow:**\n- **Current NOI:** $141,597\n- **Monthly Cash Flow:** $141,597 / 12 - $177,013 / 12 = $11,799.75 - $14,751.08 = **-$2,951.33**\n\n**DSCR:**\n- **Current DSCR (6-month period):** $141,597 / $177,013 = **0.80**\n\n**Analysis:** \n- Even with the seller carrying the down payment and allowing for a 6-month IO period, you're still at a negative cash flow and a DSCR below 1. \n- This structure does not solve the fundamental issues of negative cash flow and unrealistic expenses.\n\n### 2. Equity Partner Structure\n\n**Deal Structure:**\n- **Purchase Price:** $2,700,000\n- **Senior Bank Loan (70% LTV):** $1,890,000\n- **Total Equity Required:** $810,000\n- **Equity Partner (95%):** $769,500\n- **USER (5% - GP/Operator):** $40,500\n\n**Financing Terms:**\n- **Bank Loan:** $1,890,000 @ 7.25%, 30-year amortization\n  - **Annual Debt Service:** $154,735\n- **Partner Preferred Return:** 8% on $769,500 = $61,560/year\n\n**Cash Flow Waterfall:**\n- **Net Operating Income (NOI):** $141,597\n- **Bank Debt Service:** ($154,735)\n- **Partner Preferred Return:** ($61,560)\n- **Net to USER:** $141,597 - $154,735 - $61,560 = **-$74,698**\n\n**DSCR:**\n- **Current DSCR:** $141,597 / ($154,735 + $61,560) = $141,597 / $216,295 = **0.65**\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The equity partner structure also leads to negative cash flow and does not meet the required thresholds.\n- The partner does not receive any return, creating potential issues in the partnership.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth structures lead to negative cash flow and fail to meet the necessary DSCR of 1.25. \n\n- **Seller Carry:** While it provides some short-term relief, it doesn't address the fundamental issue of cash flow and expenses. The structure still results in a monthly burn rate.\n- **Equity Partnership:** This structure also fails to provide positive cash flow or a return for the partner, which is essential for keeping a healthy partnership.\n\n### Final Verdict\nThe deal remains unviable under both restructuring scenarios. The fundamental problems of high expenses and low cash flow remain unresolved, making it a **PASS**. Without significant changes to the purchase price, expense assumptions, or a substantial increase in market rents, these structures won't make the deal work."
