RISKS / RED FLAGS\n\n### 🚨 **CRITICAL DEAL-KILLER ISSUES:**\n\n1. **FRAUDULENT EXPENSE UNDERWRITING** \n   - Expenses shown at $26,223 ($6,556/unit)\n   - Real expenses: $76,017 ($19,004/unit)\n   - **Broker is lying by $49,794/year (190% understatement)**\n\n2. **PROPERTY TAX FRAUD**\n   - Shown: $3,211 (0.12% rate)\n   - Reality: $27,000 (1.0% rate)\n   - **$23,789/year lie**\n\n3. **INSURANCE FRAUD**\n   - Shown: $1,700\n   - Reality: $9,000\n   - **$7,300/year lie**\n\n4. **ZERO RESERVES**\n   - Should be $8,391-16,782/year\n   - Not included at all\n\n5. **PRICE PER UNIT AT $675,000**\n   - This is luxury condo pricing\n   - Multifamily should be $200-350k/unit in Phoenix\n   - **You're overpaying by $1.3M - $1.9M**\n\n6. **BRAND NEW 2024 CONSTRUCTION AT 5.25% CAP (FAKE) / 3.4% CAP (REAL)**\n   - Developer knows this doesn't work financially\n   - They're dumping at peak pricing\n   - You're the greater fool exit strategy\n\n7. **NO PARKING IN PHOENIX**\n   - Major tenant retention issue\n   - Limits tenant pool\n   - Reduces rent ceiling\n\n8. **NEGATIVE CASHFLOW IN ALL SCENARIOS**\n   - Standard financing: -$5,818/month\n   - Seller carry: -$8,068/month  \n   - Equity partner: -$10,318/month\n   - No creative structure fixes fundamentally broken economics\n\n9. **ZERO VALUE-ADD RUNWAY**\n   - Rents already maxed at $2.25-2.82/SF (market is $1.80-2.20)\n   - Brand new construction = no renovation upside\n   - Already individually metered for most utilities\n   - Only value-add is RUBS ($5,600) and expense cuts ($10,213)\n\n10. **CANNOT EXIT**\n    - Property worth $1.9M at stabilization\n    - You're paying $2.7M\n    - **$781,000 value destruction on day one**\n    - Cannot refinance (would need to bring $600k to refi)\n    - Cannot sell (would be short $146k minimum)\n\n---\n\n### **MARKET RISKS:**\n\n**Phoenix Market Cooling:**\n- Rent growth slowing from peak\n- Cap rates expanding (bad for value)\n- 2024 peak construction pricing\n- Overbuilt in luxury segment\n\n**Interest Rate Risk:**\n- Locked into 7% rate\n- If rates drop, helps refinance but property still underwater\n- If rates rise, makes exit worse\n\n**Expense Risk:**\n- Property taxes will reset to assessed value\n- Insurance costs rising in Phoenix\n- New construction warranty expires = real R&M costs hit\n\n---\n\n### **FINANCING RISKS:**\n\n**Cannot Qualify for Standard Loan:**\n- DSCR of 0.57 with realistic expenses\n- Need 60%+ down payment to get DSCR > 1.0\n- That's $1,620,000 cash required\n\n**Seller Carry Doesn't Help:**\n- Still negative cashflow\n- Balloon payment you can't refinance\n- Accumulate massive losses\n\n**Equity Partner Structure Fails:**\n- Can't pay pref returns\n- Can't buyout partner\n- Partnership lawsuit guaranteed\n\n---\n\n### **MISSING DATA THAT MAKES THIS WORSE:**\n\n- No actual T12 (brand new)\n- No verified rent comps\n- No parking details\n- No utility bill breakdown\n- No property management costs (using estimates)\n- No actual occupancy history\n- No lease terms (are these short-term rentals? Month-to-month?)\n\n---\n\n## 8. FINAL VERDICT\n\n# 🔴 **HARD PASS** \n\n## **PASS because this is a financial dumpster fire with fraudulent expense underwriting that creates $70k-124k annual losses using realistic numbers, has zero value-add opportunities, is overpriced by $700k-1.9M, cannot be financed by any lender who can read a financial statement, and would result in foreclosure within 18-24 months regardless of what creative structure you attempt.**\n\n---\n\n### **The Brutal Truth:**\n\nThis deal is **felony-level broker fraud dressed up as new construction**.\n\nThe NOI is a **complete fabrication**:\n- Property taxes understated by **$23,789/year** (800% lie)\n- Insurance understated by **$7,300/year** (430% lie)  \n- No reserves = **$8,391/year** missing\n- Total expense lie: **$49,794/year**\n\nWhen you use **actual Phoenix market expenses**, the NOI collapses from $141,597 to $91,803 — a **35% fraud**.\n\nAt $91,803 NOI on $2,700,000 price, you're buying at a **3.4% cap rate** for a 4-unit property with:\n- No parking\n- Rents already maxed out\n- Zero renovation upside\n- New construction expenses kicking in after warranty\n\n**No amount of creative financing fixes a deal that's $700,000+ overpriced.**\n\n### **The Math Doesn't Lie:**\n\n**Standard Financing (75% LTV):**\n- Monthly cashflow: **-$5,818**\n- DSCR: **0.57**\n- You're bleeding **$70k/year**\n\n**Seller Carry Structure:**\n- Monthly cashflow: **-$8,068**\n- Combined DSCR: **0.49**\n- You're bleeding **$97k/year**\n- 5-year losses: **$545,013**\n\n**Equity Partner Structure:**\n- Real's monthly cashflow: **-$10,318**\n- Partner's unpaid pref: **$270k over 5 years**\n- Real's 5-year losses: **$579k**\n- Cannot refi to buy out partner\n\n**Exit Reality:**\n- Stabilized value: **$1,918,887**\n- You paid: **$2,700,000**\n- **Value destruction: $781,113**\n- Cannot refinance (short $607k)\n- Cannot sell (short $146k minimum)\n\n### **This Is a Foreclosure Waiting to Happen**\n\nYou would be **insolvent from day one**, accumulate losses every month, and have **no exit strategy** that doesn't involve writing a six-figure check just to get out.\n\nThe seller is a developer who built at peak 2024 pricing, knows these numbers don't work, and is desperately trying to find a greater fool to dump this on before everyone realizes Phoenix luxury 4-plexes at $675k/unit is peak bubble insanity.\n\n**This broker is either:**\n1. Criminally incompetent\n2. Committing fraud\n3. Praying you can't underwrite\n\n**Don't call back. Don't negotiate. Block the number.**\n\nIf you want to deploy $135k-675k in Phoenix multifamily, find a 1970s-1980s value-add property at 6-7% cap with real upside, not a brand-new luxury money pit priced like it's the fucking Four Seasons.\n\n**Hard pass. Next deal.**",
