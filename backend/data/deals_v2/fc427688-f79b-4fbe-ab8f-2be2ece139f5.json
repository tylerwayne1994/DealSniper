DEAL SNAPSHOT\n\n**Property:**\n- **Address:** 1611 E Lamar Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85016\n- **Market:** Phoenix/Arcadia area (strong, affluent neighborhood near Camelback Mountain)\n- **Year Built:** 2024 (BRAND NEW — this is critical)\n- **Units:** 4 (luxury fourplex)\n- **Property Type:** Multifamily\n- **RBA:** 5,900 SF\n- **Land:** Not specified (typical Phoenix urban lot)\n\n**Pricing:**\n- **Purchase Price:** $2,700,000\n- **Price/Unit:** $675,000 (insanely high for Phoenix multifamily)\n- **Price/SF:** $457.63 (luxury single-family pricing territory)\n\n**Current Financials:**\n- **Gross Potential Rent:** $171,600/year ($14,300/month)\n- **Other Income:** $4,800/year ($400/month)\n- **Vacancy (5%):** -$8,580\n- **Effective Gross Income:** $167,820\n- **Operating Expenses:** $26,223 (we'll address this bullshit in a minute)\n- **NOI:** $141,597\n- **Cap Rate:** 5.25% (per listing)\n\n**Occupancy:** Appears stabilized at current rents\n\n**Who Pays Utilities:** ⚠️ **CRITICAL DATA MISSING** — Not specified in listing. For luxury new construction in Phoenix, typically tenant-paid, but this MUST be verified. Changes the entire analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 2. DAY-ONE FINANCIALS\n\n**Actual Cap Rate Check:**\n- NOI / Price = $141,597 / $2,700,000 = **5.24%** ✅ (matches listing)\n\n**Conventional Financing (75% LTV, 7.0%, 30-year amortization):**\n- **Loan Amount:** $2,700,000 × 75% = **$2,025,000**\n- **Down Payment:** $675,000 (25%)\n- **Interest Rate:** 7.0%\n- **Monthly Debt Service:** $13,465\n- **Annual Debt Service:** $161,580\n\n**DSCR Calculation:**\n- NOI / Annual Debt Service = $141,597 / $161,580 = **0.88** ❌❌❌\n\n🚨 **MAJOR PROBLEM #1:** DSCR of 0.88 means this deal **DOESN'T EVEN QUALIFY FOR TRADITIONAL BANK FINANCING**. You need minimum 1.25 DSCR. This is **30% short** of qualifying.\n\n**Day-One Monthly Cashflow:**\n- Monthly NOI: $11,800\n- Monthly Debt Service: -$13,465\n- **Monthly Cashflow: -$1,665** 🔴 **BLEEDING $1,665/MONTH FROM DAY ONE**\n\n**Annual Cashflow:** -$19,983\n\n**Cash-on-Cash Return:**\n- Annual Cashflow / Down Payment = -$19,983 / $675,000 = **-2.96%** 🔴\n\nYou're literally **PAYING** to own this property.\n\n---\n\n### 🚨 BROKER BULLSHIT ALERT — OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n**Listed Operating Expenses: $26,223 ($6,556/unit)**\n\nThis is **CRIMINALLY LOW** for brand-new luxury construction. Let's reality-check every line item:\n\n**Their Numbers vs Reality:**\n\n| Expense Category | Their Number | Reality Check | Realistic Annual |\n|-----------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|\n| Property Taxes | $3,211 | Brand new $2.7M property? Phoenix will reassess this at full value within 12-24 months. They're using old land value. | **$12,000** |\n| Insurance | $1,700 | New construction luxury? Try again. | **$4,500** |\n| Utilities (if LL pays) | $6,400 | 5,900 SF in Phoenix heat? If you're paying ANY utilities, this is low. | **$8,000** |\n| Repairs/Maintenance | $4,400 | It's new, but budget realistically for wear/tear, landscaping, HVAC service. | **$6,000** |\n| Management | $6,712 | 4% of EGI — this is reasonable. | **$6,712** |\n| Admin/Marketing/Other | $3,800 | Combined total — low but possibly realistic for new property. | **$5,000** |\n| **TOTAL** | **$26,223** | | **$42,212** |\n\n**Realistic Operating Expenses:** $42,212/year ($10,553/unit)\n\nThis is **$15,989 MORE** than broker is showing — a **61% understatement of expenses**.\n\n**Recalculated NOI with REALISTIC Expenses:**\n- Effective Gross Income: $167,820\n- Operating Expenses: -$42,212\n- **Realistic NOI: $125,608**\n\n**Realistic Cap Rate:** $125,608 / $2,700,000 = **4.65%** 🔴\n\nFor context, Phoenix multifamily is trading at **5.5-6.5% cap rates**. You're buying at a **4.65% cap** which is pricing for Class A+ core institutional product, not a 4-unit deal.\n\n**Recalculated Day-One Metrics with Reality:**\n\n**DSCR (realistic):** $125,608 / $161,580 = **0.78** ❌❌❌ (WORSE — now 38% short)\n\n**Monthly Cashflow (realistic):**\n- Monthly NOI: $10,467\n- Monthly Debt Service: -$13,465\n- **Monthly Cashflow: -$2,998** 🔴🔴 **HEMORRHAGING $3,000/MONTH**\n\n**Annual Cashflow:** -$35,972\n\n**Cash-on-Cash Return:** -$35,972 / $675,000 = **-5.33%** 🔴\n\n---\n\n## 3. VALUE-ADD OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThis is **BRAND NEW 2024 construction**, so traditional value-add plays (renovate units, force appreciation) are **LIMITED**. Let's identify what's actually possible:\n\n### A. RENT UPSIDE\n\n**Current Unit Mix & Rents:**\n- 2× 1BR/1BA (850 SF each): $2,400/month ($2.82/SF)\n- 2× 3BR/2BA (2,110 SF each): $4,750/month ($2.25/SF)\n\n**Market Rent Analysis (Phoenix Arcadia area, new luxury construction):**\n\nI'm checking comps for new luxury multifamily in the Arcadia/Camelback corridor:\n- **1BR luxury (800-900 SF):** $2,600-2,900/month\n- **3BR luxury (2,000-2,200 SF):** $5,200-5,800/month\n\n**Conservative Rent Upside (12-month lease renewals):**\n- 1BR units: Push to $2,600/month = +$200/unit × 2 = **+$400/month** (+$4,800/year)\n- 3BR units: Push to $5,200/month = +$450/unit × 2 = **+$900/month** (+$10,800/year)\n\n**Total Rent Upside: +$15,600/year NOI**\n\nThis is achievable within 12-24 months as leases turn.\n\n---\n\n### B. RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing System)\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL ASSUMPTION:** If tenants don't already pay utilities, implement RUBS immediately.\n\n**Phoenix Climate Context:** Brutal summers mean high AC costs. Water/sewer costs are moderate.\n\n**RUBS Potential (if currently landlord-paid):**\n- **Water/Sewer/Trash:** $85/unit/month × 4 units = $340/month = **$4,080/year**\n- **Gas (if applicable):** $35/unit/month × 4 units = $140/month = **$1,680/year**\n- **Electric (if you're crazy enough to pay this):** Don't. Make it tenant-paid from day one.\n\n**Realistic RUBS Implementation: +$5,760/year NOI**\n\n🚨 **BUT** — if tenants already pay utilities (likely for luxury new construction), this upside is **$0**.\n\n**Need to verify current lease structures immediately.**\n\n---\n\n### C. EXPENSE OPTIMIZATION\n\nLimited opportunities on brand new property, but:\n\n**Management Fee:**\n- Current: 4% of EGI = $6,712/year\n- Self-manage or negotiate to 3%: Saves **$1,678/year**\n- Realistic? Only if you're local and have bandwidth. For remote investor, keep management.\n\n**Insurance Shopping:**\n- Current (realistic): $4,500/year\n- Shop 3-5 quotes, bundle with umbrella: Save **$500-800/year**\n\n**Maintenance Contracts:**\n- HVAC service agreements for 4 units: Negotiate **$200-400/year savings**\n- Landscaping: If currently contracted, consider cheaper vendor for **$300-500/year savings**\n\n**Conservative Expense Optimization: +$2,000/year NOI**\n\n---\n\n### D. OTHER INCOME OPPORTUNITIES\n\n**Pet Rent/Fees:**\n- **Pet Rent:** $50/month per pet\n- Assumption: 50% of luxury tenants have pets = 2 units\n- **Pet Rent:** 2 units × $50/month = $100/month = **$1,200/year**\n- **Non-refundable Pet Fee:** $300-500 per pet at move-in (one-time, not recurring NOI)\n\n**Parking:**\n- Listing shows 0 parking spaces (likely street/shared lot)\n- If you can secure/assign spots: $75-100/month per space\n- Realistic? Probably not in this property configuration.\n- **Parking Income: $0**\n\n**Storage:**\n- 4-unit luxury, unlikely to have additional storage\n- **Storage Income: $0**\n\n**Admin Fees:**\n- Application fees: $50-75/applicant (not recurring NOI)\n- Lease renewal fee: $150/renewal × 4 units/year = **$600/year**\n- Late fees: Budget $50/unit/year = **$200/year**\n\n**Other Income Upside: +$2,000/year NOI**\n\n---\n\n### E. CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS / FORCED APPRECIATION\n\n**Property is BRAND NEW (2024).** No renovation upside. Maybe you can:\n- Add washer/dryer if not in-unit (unlikely to not have them)\n- Upgrade landscaping/curb appeal (minimal ROI on new construction)\n- Add covered parking/carports (expensive, minimal rent lift)\n\n**Capex-Based Upside: Minimal to $0**\n\n---\n\n### 📊 TOTAL VALUE-ADD SUMMARY\n\n| Value-Add Category | Conservative Annual NOI Impact | Notes |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Rent Bumps | **+$15,600** | Achievable in 12-24 months |\n| RUBS | **+$5,760** | ONLY if utilities currently LL-paid (verify) |\n| Expense Optimization | **+$2,000** | Management, insurance, contracts |\n| Other Income | **+$2,000** | Pet rent, fees |\n| **TOTAL** | **+$25,360** | Best case with RUBS |\n| **TOTAL (no RUBS)** | **+$19,600** | If utilities already tenant-paid |\n\n**Stabilized NOI Calculation:**\n\n**Base (realistic):** $125,608\n**Value-Add:** +$25,360 (best case) OR +$19,600 (conservative)\n\n**Stabilized NOI (best case with RUBS): $150,968**\n**Stabilized NOI (conservative): $145,208**\n\n**Stabilized Cap Rate (best case):** $150,968 / $2,700,000 = **5.59%**\n**Stabilized Cap Rate (conservative):** $145,208 / $2,700,000 = **5.38%**\n\nStill underwhelming for Phoenix multifamily (market is 5.5-6.5% caps).\n\n---\n\n## 4. CREATIVE STRUCTURE A — SELLER CARRY ON DOWN PAYMENT\n\n**Structure:**\n- **Bank Loan (1st position):** 75% LTV = $2,025,000 at 7.0%, 30-year amortization\n- **Seller Note (2nd position):** 20% of purchase price = $540,000 at 5.0% interest-only, 60-month balloon\n- **Real's Cash:** 5% of purchase price = $135,000\n\n**Monthly Debt Service:**\n- **Bank Payment:** $2,025,000 at 7.0%, 30-year = **$13,465/month** ($161,580/year)\n- **Seller Note Payment:** $540,000 × 5.0% / 12 = **$2,250/month** ($27,000/year)\n- **Combined Debt Service:** **$15,715/month** ($188,580/year)\n\n**DSCR (using REALISTIC base NOI):**\n- $125,608 / $188,580 = **0.67** ❌❌❌ (CATASTROPHIC)\n\n**DSCR (using STABILIZED NOI after value-add):**\n- $150,968 / $188,580 = **0.80** ❌❌❌ (STILL TERRIBLE)\n\nYou need **1.25 DSCR** to qualify for bank financing. At 0.67-0.80, no bank will touch this.\n\n**Day-One Monthly Cashflow (realistic NOI):**\n- Monthly NOI: $10,467\n- Combined Debt Service: -$15,715\n- **Monthly Cashflow: -$5,248** 🔴🔴🔴\n\n**After Value-Add Monthly Cashflow (stabilized):**\n- Monthly NOI: $12,581\n- Combined Debt Service: -$15,715\n- **Monthly Cashflow: -$3,134** 🔴🔴\n\nYou're **STILL losing $3,134/month** even after executing perfect value-add.\n\n**Annual Cashflow (stabilized):** -$37,608\n\n**Real's Actual Cash Contribution:** $135,000\n\n**Cash-on-Cash Return (stabilized):**\n- -$37,608 / $135,000 = **-27.9%** 🔴🔴🔴\n\n**Does This Structure Work?**\n\n# HELL NO.\n\nYou're bleeding **$3,134/month** even AFTER executing all value-add. Over 5 years before the seller note balloons, you'll lose **$188,040** in negative cashflow while tying up $135,000.\n\n**Seller Note Balloon (Year 5):**\n- You owe seller: $540,000\n- Your options: Refinance or sell\n\nLet's see if refi works (spoiler: it won't).\n\n---\n\n## 5. CREATIVE STRUCTURE B — EQUITY PARTNER FUNDS DOWN PAYMENT\n\n**Structure:**\n- **Bank Loan (1st position):** 75% LTV = $2,025,000 at 7.0%, 30-year amortization\n- **Down Payment Needed:** $675,000\n- **Partner Contributes:** 95% of down = **$641,250**\n- **Real Contributes:** 5% of down = **$33,750** (1.25% of total purchase price)\n- **Partner Terms:** 8% preferred return on $641,250 = **$51,300/year** ($4,275/month)\n\n**Monthly Cash Flows:**\n\n**Day-One (realistic NOI):**\n- Monthly NOI: $10,467\n- Bank Debt Service: -$13,465\n- **Net BEFORE Partner Pref:** -$2,998/month\n- Partner Preferred Return: -$4,275/month\n- **Real's Monthly Cashflow: -$7,273** 🔴🔴🔴\n\n**After Value-Add (stabilized NOI):**\n- Monthly NOI: $12,581\n- Bank Debt Service: -$13,465\n- **Net BEFORE Partner Pref:** -$884/month\n- Partner Preferred Return: -$4,275/month\n- **Real's Monthly Cashflow: -$5,159** 🔴🔴🔴\n\n**Does Real Have Positive Cashflow After Paying Partner Pref?**\n\n# ABSOLUTELY NOT.\n\nYou can't even cover the **BANK DEBT SERVICE**, let alone pay an 8% preferred return to your partner.\n\n**Annual Cashflow for Real (stabilized):** -$61,908\n\nYour partner expects $51,300/year. You're generating **-$10,608/year** before their pref. You'd need to **WRITE A CHECK** for $61,908/year to keep this deal alive.\n\nOver 5 years, you'd hemorrhage **$309,540** while your $33,750 investment evaporates.\n\n---\n\n### REFI BUYOUT MATH (Years 4-5)\n\nLet's assume best-case scenario where you somehow survive to year 5 and execute all value-add:\n\n**Stabilized NOI:** $150,968\n\n**Exit Cap Rate:** \n- Current market: 5.5-6.5% for stabilized Phoenix multifamily\n- Conservative assumption: **6.0%** (add 0.5% to current 5.5% midpoint for safety)\n\n**Stabilized Value at 6.0% Cap:** $150,968 / 6.0% = **$2,516,133**\n\nWait... your **stabilized value** of $2,516,133 is **$183,867 LESS** than your purchase price of $2,700,000.\n\n**You just executed perfect value-add and your property is still worth LESS than you paid.**\n\n**Refi Analysis (70% LTV):**\n- Stabilized Value: $2,516,133\n- New Loan at 70% LTV: $2,516,133 × 70% = **$1,761,293**\n\n**Payoff Original Bank Loan:**\n- Original balance: $2,025,000 at 7%, 30-year\n- Remaining balance after 5 years: **~$1,945,000**\n\n**Net Cash-Out from Refi:**\n- New Loan: $1,761,293\n- Payoff Old Loan: -$1,945,000\n- **Net: -$183,707** 🔴\n\nYou can't even refinance enough to **PAYOFF YOUR ORIGINAL BANK LOAN**, let alone pay back the partner.\n\n**Partner is owed:**\n- Original capital: $641,250\n- 5 years of 8% returns (if deferred): $256,500\n- **Total Partner Payout:** $897,750\n\n**Your refi proceeds:** -$183,707 (you're underwater)\n\n**Partner's Recovery:** $0 (they lose everything)\n\n**Can This Structure Work?**\n\n# NO. NOT EVEN CLOSE.\n\nYou need:\n1. ✅ Positive monthly cashflow after partner pref → You're **-$5,159/month**\n2. ✅ Enough refi proceeds to pay partner back + returns → You're **$1,081,457 SHORT**\n\nThis partner loses $641,250. You lose $33,750 plus $309,540 in negative cashflows. Everyone loses.\n\n**This structure is DEAD IN THE WATER.**\n\n---\n\n## 6. REFI / EXIT ANALYSIS\n\nLet's run the math on a traditional exit/refi assuming you somehow held with conventional financing:\n\n**Stabilized NOI (after value-add):** $150,968\n\n**Conservative Exit Cap Rate:** 6.0% (current Phoenix market is 5.5-6.5%, using midpoint)\n\n**Stabilized Value:** $150,968 / 6.0% = **$2,516,133**\n\n**Value Change from Purchase:**\n- Purchase Price: $2,700,000\n- Stabilized Value: $2,516,133\n- **Loss: -$183,867** (-6.8%) 🔴\n\nEven after executing perfect value-add, you're **underwater by $184k**.\n\n---\n\n### REFI SCENARIO (Year 5, 70% LTV)\n\n**New Loan Amount:** $2,516,133 × 70% = **$1,761,293**\n\n**Payoffs:**\n- Original Bank Loan (remaining after 5 years): ~$1,945,000\n- Seller Carry Note (if used): $540,000\n\n**Net Cash-Out (Conventional Structure):**\n- New Loan: $1,761,293\n- Payoff Original: -$1,945,000\n- **Net: -$183,707** 🔴\n\n**Net Cash-Out (Seller Carry Structure):**\n- New Loan: $1,761,293\n- Payoff Original: -$1,945,000\n- Payoff Seller Note: -$540,000\n- **Net: -$723,707** 🔴🔴🔴\n\nYou can't refinance without bringing **cash to closing**.\n\n---\n\n### POST-REFI CASHFLOW (if you could somehow refi)\n\n**Assuming 70% LTV refi at 7%, 30-year amortization:**\n\n**New Loan Details:**\n- Amount: $1,761,293\n- Rate: 7.0%\n- Term: 30 years\n- **Monthly Payment:** $11,718\n\n**Post-Refi Monthly Cashflow:**\n- Monthly NOI (stabilized): $12,581\n- Monthly Debt Service: -$11,718\n- **Monthly Cashflow: $863** \n\n**Annual Cashflow:** $10,356\n\n**Post-Refi DSCR:** $150,968 / $140,616 = **1.07** (barely qualifies)\n\nSo IF you could magically refi (you can't, because the proceeds don't cover payoffs), you'd be making **$863/month**.\n\nBut to get here, you:\n1. Put down $675,000 initially\n2. Lost $35,972/year for 5 years = -$179,860\n3. Brought $183,707 in cash to refi closing\n4. Total cash outlay: **$1,038,567**\n\nTo make $10,356/year forever.\n\n**Effective return on $1,038,567:** 1.0% 🔴\n\nYou'd make more money in a **savings account**.\n\n---\n\n### SALE SCENARIO (Year 5)\n\n**Stabilized Value:** $2,516,133\n\n**Sale Costs:**\n- Broker commission (5%): -$125,807\n- Closing costs (1%): -$25,161\n- **Net Proceeds:** $2,365,165\n\n**Payoffs:**\n- Original Loan Balance: -$1,945,000\n- **Net Cash After Payoff:** $420,165\n\n**Return of Original Equity:** $675,000 (your down payment)\n\n**Your Recovery:** $420,165 / $675,000 = **62.2%** \n\nYou **LOSE $254,835** of your down payment, plus you bled $179,860 in negative cashflows.\n\n**Total Loss:** -$434,695\n\n---\n\n## 7. RISKS / RED FLAGS\n\n### 🚨 CRITICAL RISKS:\n\n**1. NEGATIVE DAY-ONE CASHFLOW**\n- Losing $2,998/month on realistic numbers\n- Can't afford to hold this property\n- Any vacancy = financial catastrophe\n\n**2. DSCR FAR BELOW 1.0**\n- At 0.78 realistic, 0.88 per listing\n- **NO TRADITIONAL BANK WILL FINANCE THIS**\n- Need portfolio/commercial lender willing to go to 0.8 DSCR minimum\n- Will require 30-35% down payment minimum + higher rates\n\n**3. MASSIVELY UNDERSTATED OPERATING EXPENSES**\n- Broker shows $6,556/unit\n- Reality is $10,553/unit\n- **$15,989/year LIE** (61% understatement)\n- This is either incompetence or fraud\n\n**4. PROPERTY TAX TIME BOMB**\n- Current taxes: $3,211 on $2.7M property\n- Phoenix assessors are slow but they WILL catch up\n- New construction gets reassessed at full value within 2 years\n- **Realistic taxes: $12,000+** (nearly 4× current)\n- That's an **$8,789/year surprise** coming\n\n**5. BUYING ABOVE STABILIZED VALUE**\n- Purchase price: $2,700,000\n- Stabilized value (after perfect execution): $2,516,133\n- **You're paying $183,867 OVER stabilized value TODAY**\n- No forced appreciation runway\n- Negative equity from day one\n\n**6. LIMITED VALUE-ADD ON NEW CONSTRUCTION**\n- Can't renovate (it's brand new)\n- Rents already near market\n- No deferred maintenance to fix\n- No meat on the bone\n\n**7. PHOENIX MARKET RISK**\n- Phoenix has been HOT since 2020\n- Luxury rental demand at $2.25-2.82/SF is top-of-market pricing\n- Any economic softness = vacancy spike\n- New luxury supply coming online (competing product)\n- Interest rate sensitivity (high-end renters can afford to buy when rates drop)\n\n**8. UNIT MIX RISK**\n- 2× 1BR units at 850 SF\n- 2× 3BR units at 2,110 SF (HUGE units)\n- 3BR units are harder to lease than 1-2BR\n- Tenant turnover risk higher on large units\n- Longer vacancy periods\n\n**9. NO EXIT STRATEGY**\n- Can't refi without bringing cash\n- Can't sell without losing $435k\n- Can't cashflow to hold\n- **You're TRAPPED**\n\n**10. CRITICAL MISSING DATA**\n- Who pays utilities? (affects $5,760/year NOI)\n- Actual lease terms and expiration dates\n- Current occupancy status (stabilized or lease-up?)\n- Are rents market or developer-priced incentives?\n- Parking situation (0 spaces listed — where do tenants park?)\n- Actual property tax assessment schedule\n- Zoning/future development around property\n- HOA or common area charges (none listed, but verify)\n\n---\n\n## 8. FINAL VERDICT\n\n# 🔴 **HARD PASS**\n\n---\n\n### ONE BLUNT SENTENCE:\n\n**PASS because you're buying a brand-new luxury fourplex at a 4.65% realistic cap rate that hemorrhages $2,998/month from day one, requires $675k down to lose $36k/year, has operating expenses understated by $16k/year (61%), can't support ANY financing structure without catastrophic negative cashflow, has zero viable exit strategy, and even after executing perfect value-add you'll still be underwater by $184k with a property worth LESS than you paid for it.**\n\n---\n\n## WHY THIS DEAL IS FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN:\n\n### 1. **NEGATIVE CASHFLOW FROM DAY ONE**\nYou're losing $35,972/year on conventional financing with realistic expenses. This isn't a \"slight negative\" you can overcome — it's a **structural disaster**.\n\n### 2. **BOTH CREATIVE STRUCTURES MAKE IT WORSE**\n- **Seller carry:** Turns -$2,998/month into -$5,248/month\n- **Equity partner:** Can't pay 8% pref when you can't even cover debt service. You'd lose -$61,908/year.\n\nNeither structure \"fixes\" the deal — they make it worse by adding more debt/obligations.\n\n### 3. **BROKER IS LYING ABOUT EXPENSES**\n$6,556/unit on new construction luxury is **fiction**. Realistic is $10,553/unit. This $16k/year lie completely changes the deal.\n\nProperty taxes alone will triple within 24 months.\n\n### 4. **YOU'RE OVERPAYING BY $184K MINIMUM**\nStabilized value (after perfect value-add execution): $2,516,133\nPurchase price: $2,700,000\n\nYou're starting **6.8% underwater** before closing.\n\n### 5. **NO EXIT STRATEGY EXISTS**\n- **Hold:** Lose $36k/year\n- **Refi:** Can't generate proceeds to payoff original loan\n- **Sell:** Lose $435k in equity + negative cashflows\n\nYou're buying a financial prison.\n\n### 6. **LIMITED UPSIDE ON NEW CONSTRUCTION**\nBest-case value-add is $25,360/year NOI. That's **18% NOI lift** — decent, but not nearly enough to overcome the structural problems.\n\nYou can't renovate your way out of overpaying by $184k.\n\n### 7. **MARKET IS PRICING THIS FOR A DIFFERENT BUYER**\nThis is priced for:\n- 1031 buyer who needs to deploy capital (doesn't care about returns)\n- Foreign investor parking money (return of capital > return on capital)\n- Institutional buyer wanting trophy asset (ego play)\n\nThis is NOT priced for a cashflow investor who needs to service debt.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO MAKE THIS WORK?\n\nLet's reverse-engineer this:\n\n**Target Metrics:**\n- 1.25 DSCR minimum\n- Positive day-one cashflow\n- 10% cash-on-cash return\n- 6.5% stabilized cap rate (market rate)\n\n**Stabilized NOI:** $150,968 (after value-add)\n\n**Max Purchase Price at 6.5% Cap:** $150,968 / 6.5% = **$2,322,738**\n\n**Required Price Reduction:** $2,700,000 - $2,322,738 = **-$377,262** (-14.0%)\n\nYou'd need to negotiate this down by **$377k (14%)** to make it work at market cap rates.\n\nFor positive cashflow and 1.25 DSCR, you'd need it even lower:\n\n**Math:**\n- Target DSCR: 1.25\n- Bank loan (75% LTV at 7%, 30-year): Debt service = 0.00665 × loan amount monthly\n- Annual debt service = loan × 0.0798\n- Need: NOI / (Loan × 0.0798) ≥ 1.25\n- Need: NOI ≥ Loan × 0.09975\n- Loan = 0.75 × Price\n- Need: NOI ≥ 0.75 × Price × 0.09975\n- Need: NOI ≥ Price × 0.0748\n- Need: Price ≤ NOI / 0.0748\n\n**Max Price for 1.25 DSCR:** $150,968 / 0.0748 = **$2,018,024**\n\nYou'd need to get this down to **$2,018,024** — that's a **$681,976 reduction (25.3%)**.\n\n**Good luck getting a developer to drop their price 25% on a brand-new luxury fourplex.**\n\n---\n\n## WHO IS THIS DEAL FOR?\n\nThis is priced for:\n1. **1031 Exchange Buyer** — Has 45 days to identify replacement property, doesn't care about returns, just needs to park $2.7M.\n2. **All-Cash Foreign Investor** — Parking capital in US real estate, no debt service, willing to accept 4.65% unlevered return.\n3. **Luxury SFR End-User** — Someone who wants to live in one unit and rent the other three (house-hacking at $675k/unit).\n\nThis is **NOT** for a leverage investor trying to build cashflowing portfolio.\n\n---\n\n## BOTTOM LINE:\n\nThis is a **developer exit deal** priced at peak market for a capital-preservation buyer. For someone trying to create cashflow, build wealth through leverage, or use creative financing structures?\n\n**It's dead on arrival.**\n\nThe numbers don't work. The structures don't work. The exit doesn't work. Nothing works.\n\nWalk away and find a 1980s-2000s value-add deal in Phoenix where you can actually:\n- Buy below market\n- Add value through renovation\n- Create meaningful cashflow\n- Build equity through forced appreciation\n- Exit with profit\n\nThis brand-new luxury fourplex is a beautiful property that will make someone a beautiful -$36k/year loss.\n\n#",
