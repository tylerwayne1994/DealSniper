      "content": "You're correct that tenants generally do not appear to be paying for utilities based on the provided data. To lower expenses, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Implement RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing System):**\n   - Charge tenants for utilities based on their unit size or occupancy. This incentivizes energy conservation and can significantly reduce the owner's utility costs.\n\n2. **Trim Utility Expenses:**\n   - Review utility bills for inconsistencies or overcharges. Negotiate with utility providers for better rates or explore energy-efficient upgrades that reduce overall consumption.\n\n3. **Evaluate Management Fees:**\n   - Assess the management fee structure. If it exceeds market averages (usually around 5-10% of gross income), consider renegotiating or switching management companies.\n\n4. **Reduce Maintenance Costs:**\n   - Regularly schedule preventative maintenance to avoid larger repair costs later. Also, consider using in-house staff for maintenance rather than outsourcing.\n\n5. **Optimize Administrative Expenses:**\n   - Review administrative costs for any unnecessary expenditures. Look for subscriptions or services that can be eliminated or consolidated.\n\n6. **Insurance Review:**\n   - Shop around for insurance to ensure you’re getting the best rate. Consider bundling policies or increasing deductibles to lower premiums.\n\n7. **Review Contract Services:**\n   - Evaluate contracts for services like pest control, landscaping, or cleaning. These might be renegotiated for better pricing or frequency based on actual needs.\n\n8. **Monitor Repairs and Maintenance:**\n   - Normalize repair expenses to market levels. If you're over-spending on repairs, it may indicate either mismanagement or unnecessary maintenance.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you could potentially lower operating expenses, thus increasing your NOI and overall property profitability."
