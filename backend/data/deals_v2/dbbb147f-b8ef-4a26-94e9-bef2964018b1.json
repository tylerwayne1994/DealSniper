DEAL SNAPSHOT\n\n**Property Details:**\n- **Address:** 1611 E Lamar Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85016\n- **Market:** Phoenix - Central Corridor (85016 is Arcadia/Biltmore area - solid neighborhood)\n- **Year Built:** 2024 (brand fucking new - red flag #1)\n- **Units:** 4 units (small multifamily - harder to finance and exit)\n- **Property Type:** Multifamily\n- **Square Footage:** 5,900 SF total\n\n**Unit Mix:**\n- 2x 1BR/1BA @ 850 SF → $2,400/month each = $4,800/month\n- 2x 3BR/2BA @ 2,110 SF → $4,750/month each = $9,500/month\n- **Total Monthly Rent:** $14,300\n\n**Pricing:**\n- **Purchase Price:** $2,700,000\n- **Price/Unit:** $675,000 (INSANE for a 4-plex)\n- **Price/SF:** $457.63 (luxury pricing)\n\n**Current Performance (Per Broker):**\n- **Gross Potential Rent:** $171,600/year\n- **Other Income:** $4,800/year ($100/unit/month - parking/storage/whatever)\n- **Vacancy (5%):** -$8,580\n- **Effective Gross Income:** $167,820\n- **Operating Expenses:** $26,223 ($6,556/unit - LAUGHABLY low)\n- **NOI:** $141,597\n- **Broker Cap Rate:** 5.25%\n- **Occupancy:** Assumed 95%\n\n**Who Pays Utilities?** \n**MISSING DATA** - This is CRITICAL. Expenses show $6,400 for utilities ($1,600/unit/year). If owner pays all utilities, this number is bullshit. If tenant pays, then this is just common area - need clarification.\n\n---\n\n## 2. DAY-ONE FINANCIALS\n\n**Actual Cap Rate Check:**\n- NOI / Price = $141,597 / $2,700,000 = **5.24% ✓** (matches broker's claim)\n\n**Now let's test if this deal actually qualifies for financing:**\n\n**Conventional Loan Structure (75% LTV):**\n- Loan Amount: $2,025,000 (75% of $2,700,000)\n- Down Payment: $675,000 (25%)\n- Interest Rate: 7.0% (current market for small multifamily)\n- Term: 30 years\n- Amortization: 30 years\n- Monthly Payment (P&I): **$13,471**\n- Annual Debt Service: **$161,652**\n\n**DSCR Calculation:**\n- DSCR = NOI / Annual Debt Service\n- DSCR = $141,597 / $161,652\n- **DSCR = 0.88** ❌❌❌\n\n🚨 **HOLY SHIT - THIS DEAL FAILS DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE** 🚨\n\nBanks require **minimum 1.25 DSCR** for multifamily. At 0.88, you're not even covering the debt service, let alone having a buffer. **This deal will NOT qualify for 75% LTV financing.**\n\n**Day-One Monthly Cashflow:**\n- Monthly NOI: $11,800 ($141,597 / 12)\n- Monthly Debt Service: -$13,471\n- **Monthly Cashflow: -$1,671** (NEGATIVE)\n- **Annual Cashflow: -$20,055** (BLEEDING MONEY)\n\n**Cash-on-Cash Return:**\n- Annual Cashflow / Cash Invested = -$20,055 / $675,000\n- **CoC Return = -2.97%** (YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF OWNING THIS TURD)\n\n---\n\n### 🔴 BROKER BULLSHIT DETECTOR - EXPENSES\n\nLet's reality-check these expenses at $26,223 total ($6,556/unit):\n\n**Broker's Expense Breakdown:**\n- Taxes: $3,211 ($803/unit) - probably LOW for a $2.7M property\n- Insurance: $1,700 ($425/unit) - ABSURDLY LOW\n- Utilities: $6,400 ($1,600/unit) - need to know what's included\n- Repairs/Maintenance: $4,400 ($1,100/unit) - LOW even for new construction\n- Management: $6,712 (4% of EGI) - industry standard is 5-8%\n- Payroll: $0 - correct for 4 units\n- Admin: $2,050\n- Marketing: $750 ($187/unit) - LOW\n- Other: $1,000\n\n**REALISTIC EXPENSE ASSUMPTIONS:**\n\nLet me recalculate with actual market expenses:\n\n- **Taxes:** $8,100 (0.3% of $2.7M value - AZ is low tax but not THAT low)\n- **Insurance:** $3,500 ($875/unit - minimum for multifamily)\n- **Utilities:** $12,800 if owner-paid (metered separately = tenant pays)\n- **Repairs/Maintenance:** $8,000 ($2,000/unit - 5% of rent is standard reserve)\n- **Management:** $8,391 (5% of EGI - market rate)\n- **Payroll:** $0 ✓\n- **Admin:** $2,500 (higher for small properties)\n- **Marketing:** $2,000 ($500/unit - turnover happens)\n- **Other:** $2,000\n\n**REALISTIC TOTAL EXPENSES: $47,291** ($11,823/unit)\n\n**REALISTIC NOI: $120,529** (not $141,597)\n\n**REALISTIC CAP RATE: 4.46%** (absolute dogshit)\n\n**REALISTIC DSCR: 0.75** (even worse)\n\n**Let's continue analysis with BOTH scenarios:**\n- **Optimistic (Broker):** $141,597 NOI, 5.24% cap\n- **Realistic (Real):** $120,529 NOI, 4.46% cap\n\n---\n\n## 3. VALUE-ADD OPPORTUNITIES\n\n### **RENT ANALYSIS**\n\n**Current Rents:**\n- 1BR/1BA (850 SF): $2,400/month = **$2.82/SF**\n- 3BR/2BA (2,110 SF): $4,750/month = **$2.25/SF**\n\n**Phoenix Market Comps (Arcadia/Biltmore Area, 2024):**\n- 1BR apartments: $1,400-1,800/month\n- 3BR apartments: $2,200-2,800/month\n\n🚨 **WAIT, WHAT THE FUCK?** 🚨\n\n**Current rents are 33-70% ABOVE market rates** for Phoenix. These aren't market rents - these are **peak luxury new-construction rents** that will NOT hold when current tenants leave.\n\n**RENT UPSIDE: ZERO (actually DOWNSIDE risk of -$4,600/month)**\n\nIf rents normalize to market ($1,600 for 1BR, $2,500 for 3BR):\n- New monthly rent: $9,700\n- Loss: -$4,600/month = -$55,200/year\n- **New NOI: $86,397** (realistic scenario)\n- **New value at 5.25% cap: $1,645,657** (you'd lose $1,054,343)\n\nSo there's no \"rent upside\" here - you're **buying at peak rents with massive rollover risk**.\n\n---\n\n### **RUBS IMPLEMENTATION**\n\nIf utilities are owner-paid (need clarification):\n\n**Water/Sewer:**\n- Industry average: $60/unit/month\n- Annual impact: $2,880\n\n**Trash:**\n- Average: $25/unit/month  \n- Annual impact: $1,200\n\n**Gas (if applicable):**\n- Average: $30/unit/month\n- Annual impact: $1,440\n\n**Total RUBS Potential: $5,520/year additional NOI**\n\nBut given that rents are already 50% over market, good luck implementing RUBS without losing tenants.\n\n---\n\n### **EXPENSE OPTIMIZATION**\n\nStarting from broker's numbers ($26,223):\n\n**Management Fee:**\n- Current: $6,712 (4% of EGI)\n- Could self-manage or negotiate to 3%: Save $1,679/year\n\n**Repairs/Maintenance:**\n- Current: $4,400 ($1,100/unit)\n- This is already unrealistically low for any building\n- More likely to INCREASE to $8,000+ as building ages\n\n**Insurance Shopping:**\n- Current: $1,700\n- Realistic: $3,500\n- This is understated by $1,800/year\n\n**Taxes:**\n- Current: $3,211\n- After sale at $2.7M, expect reassessment to $8,100+\n- Increase of $4,889/year\n\n**Reality: Expenses will INCREASE by $5,000-7,000/year, not decrease.**\n\n---\n\n### **OTHER INCOME**\n\nCurrent other income: $4,800/year ($100/unit/month)\n\n**Additional Potential:**\n- Pet rent ($25/pet/month): $600/year (assuming 2 pets)\n- Application fees ($50/applicant): $400/year\n- Late fees: $300/year\n- Total additional: $1,300/year\n\n**But we're already at $4,800/year, so maybe $1,000 upside.**\n\n---\n\n### **TOTAL VALUE-ADD SUMMARY**\n\n**Best Case Scenario (Keeping Current Rents):**\n- RUBS implementation: +$5,520 NOI\n- Additional other income: +$1,000 NOI\n- **Total NOI Increase: $6,520**\n- **Stabilized NOI: $148,117** (using broker base)\n- **Stabilized Value at 5.25% cap: $2,821,276**\n- **Value Gain: $121,276** (4.5% over 3-5 years = shit)\n\n**Realistic Scenario (Expenses Increase, Rents Rollback):**\n- Start with realistic NOI: $120,529\n- Add RUBS: +$5,520\n- Add other income: +$1,000\n- Rent rollback on turnover: -$27,600 (50% turnover, rent drops 20%)\n- **Stabilized NOI: $99,449**\n- **Stabilized Value at 6.0% cap: $1,657,483**\n- **Value Loss: -$1,042,517** (YOU LOSE YOUR ASS)\n\n---\n\n## 4. CREATIVE STRUCTURE A — SELLER CARRY ON DOWN PAYMENT\n\n**Structure:**\n- **Bank Loan (Senior):** 75% LTV = $2,025,000 @ 7.0%, 30-year amortization\n- **Seller Note (Second):** 20% of price = $540,000 @ 5.0% interest-only, 60-month balloon\n- **Real Cash:** 5% of price = $135,000\n\n**Debt Service Breakdown:**\n\n**Bank Loan:**\n- Amount: $2,025,000\n- Rate: 7.0%\n- Term: 30 years\n- Monthly Payment: $13,471\n- Annual Debt Service: $161,652\n\n**Seller Note:**\n- Amount: $540,000\n- Rate: 5.0% interest-only\n- Monthly Payment: $2,250 ($540,000 × 0.05 / 12)\n- Annual Debt Service: $27,000\n\n**Combined Debt Service:**\n- Monthly: $15,721\n- Annual: $188,652\n\n---\n\n**Scenario A: Using Broker's Inflated NOI ($141,597)**\n\n**Combined DSCR:**\n- DSCR = $141,597 / $188,652 = **0.75** ❌\n\n**Monthly Cashflow:**\n- Monthly NOI: $11,800\n- Monthly Debt Service: -$15,721\n- **Monthly Cashflow: -$3,921** (DEEPLY NEGATIVE)\n\n**Annual Cashflow:** -$47,055\n\n**Real's Cash Investment:** $135,000\n\n**Cash-on-Cash Return:** -$47,055 / $135,000 = **-34.9%** (HOLY FUCK)\n\n---\n\n**Scenario B: Using Realistic NOI ($120,529)**\n\n**Combined DSCR:**\n- DSCR = $120,529 / $188,652 = **0.64** ❌❌\n\n**Monthly Cashflow:**\n- Monthly NOI: $10,044\n- Monthly Debt Service: -$15,721\n- **Monthly Cashflow: -$5,677** (CATASTROPHIC)\n\n**Annual Cashflow:** -$68,124\n\n**Cash-on-Cash Return:** -$68,124 / $135,000 = **-50.5%** (BURN MONEY FASTER IN A FIREPLACE)\n\n---\n\n### **DOES THIS STRUCTURE WORK?**\n\n🔴 **FUCK NO.**\n\nHere's why this is dead on arrival:\n\n1. **No bank will do a 75% LTV first lien with a 20% seller carry behind them** when the deal doesn't cashflow. They want DSCR > 1.25, not 0.75.\n\n2. **You're losing $3,900-$5,700/month** out of pocket. Over 5 years, that's $234,000-$342,000 in negative cashflow before you even face the seller's $540,000 balloon.\n\n3. **In 60 months, you owe the seller $540,000**. Where's that coming from? The property won't appreciate enough to refi and cash them out (we'll prove this in section 6).\n\n4. Even with only $135,000 of your own money in, **you're bleeding 35-50% of your investment annually**. You'd be broke in 3 years.\n\nThis structure doesn't make a bad deal good - it just **lets you lose money with less cash upfront.**\n\n---\n\n## 5. CREATIVE STRUCTURE B — EQUITY PARTNER FUNDS DOWN PAYMENT\n\n**Structure:**\n- **Bank Loan (Senior):** 75% LTV = $2,025,000 @ 7.0%, 30-year amortization\n- **Partner Capital:** 24% of price = $648,000 (pays most of down payment)\n- **Real Capital:** 1% of price = $27,000 (token skin in game)\n- **Partner Terms:** 8% preferred return annually on their $648,000\n\n**Partner Annual Preferred Return:** $51,840\n\n---\n\n**Year 1 Cashflow - Broker's NOI ($141,597):**\n\n- Annual NOI: $141,597\n- Bank Debt Service: -$161,652\n- **Cashflow Before Partner Pref: -$20,055** (already underwater)\n- Partner Pref (8% × $648,000): -$51,840\n- **Net Cashflow to Real: -$71,895** ❌❌❌\n\n**You can't even pay the mortgage, let alone the partner's pref.**\n\n---\n\n**Year 1 Cashflow - Realistic NOI ($120,529):**\n\n- Annual NOI: $120,529\n- Bank Debt Service: -$161,652\n- **Cashflow Before Partner Pref: -$41,123** (deeply underwater)\n- Partner Pref: -$51,840\n- **Net Cashflow to Real: -$92,963** ❌❌❌\n\n---\n\n**What About Monthly?**\n\n**Broker NOI:**\n- Monthly NOI: $11,800\n- Monthly Debt Service: -$13,471\n- Monthly Partner Pref: -$4,320\n- **Net Monthly to Real: -$5,991**\n\n**Realistic NOI:**\n- Monthly NOI: $10,044\n- Monthly Debt Service: -$13,471\n- Monthly Partner Pref: -$4,320\n- **Net Monthly to Real: -$7,747**\n\nYou're **losing $6,000-$7,700/month** and your partner isn't getting their 8% pref. They'll sue your ass by month 6.\n\n---\n\n### **REFI/BUYOUT ANALYSIS (YEAR 5)**\n\nLet's pretend you survive 5 years and stabilize the property:\n\n**Stabilized Performance (Best Case):**\n- Broker NOI: $141,597\n- Add RUBS: +$5,520\n- Add other income: +$1,000\n- **Stabilized NOI: $148,117**\n\n**Exit Assumptions:**\n- Exit Cap Rate: 5.75% (add 50 bps for conservative exit)\n- **Stabilized Value:** $148,117 / 0.0575 = **$2,576,122**\n\n**Refinance at 70% LTV:**\n- New Loan Amount: $1,803,285 (70% of $2,576,122)\n- Original Loan Balance After 60 Months: ~$1,956,392 (amortization schedule)\n\n**Cash Out from Refi:**\n- New Loan: $1,803,285\n- Payoff Old Loan: -$1,956,392\n- **Net Proceeds: -$153,107** (YOU'RE SHORT)\n\n🚨 **YOU CAN'T EVEN REFI TO PAY OFF THE ORIGINAL LOAN** 🚨\n\nThe property hasn't appreciated enough to extract cash. You'd need to come up with $153,107 PLUS $648,000 for the partner PLUS their accumulated unpaid prefs.\n\n---\n\n**What If You Sell Instead?**\n\n- Sale Price: $2,576,122\n- Selling Costs (6% commission + closing): -$154,567\n- Net Sale Proceeds: $2,421,555\n- Payoff Loan Balance: -$1,956,392\n- **Net Cash Before Partner:** $465,163\n\n**Payoff Partner:**\n- Partner Capital: $648,000\n- Partner Unpaid Prefs (5 years × $51,840): $259,200 (probably with interest)\n- **Total Owed to Partner: $907,200+**\n\n**Net Cash: $465,163 - $907,200 = -$442,037**\n\n**YOU'RE $442,000 SHORT OF WHAT YOU OWE YOUR PARTNER.**\n\nAnd that's before accounting for:\n- 5 years of negative cashflow you had to cover: ~$300,000+\n- Real's original $27,000 investment\n- **Total Loss: $770,000+**\n\n---\n\n### **DOES THIS STRUCTURE WORK?**\n\n🔴 **ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT.**\n\nThis structure fails on every level:\n\n1. **You can't pay the partner's 8% pref from year 1** - there's no cashflow\n2. **You have to cover $72,000/year in losses** out of pocket\n3. **After 5 years, you can't refi or sell at a profit** to buy them out\n4. **You owe them $900K+ but only have $465K** from the sale\n5. **Your partner will sue you by year 2** for non-payment of pref\n\nNo rational person would put $648,000 into this deal with these numbers. And if you found someone who would, they're either:\n- An idiot\n- Your mom\n- About to become your worst enemy in court\n\n---\n\n## 6. REFI / EXIT ANALYSIS\n\nLet's run the full exit scenarios:\n\n### **SCENARIO 1: Stabilized Exit (Best Case)**\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- You hold 5 years\n- You implement RUBS: +$5,520\n- You add other income: +$1,000\n- Current rents hold (unlikely)\n- Expenses stay flat (won't happen)\n- **Stabilized NOI: $148,117** (using broker's base)\n\n**Exit via Sale:**\n- Exit Cap Rate: 5.75% (conservative for 4-unit in Phoenix)\n- **Exit Value:** $148,117 / 0.0575 = **$2,576,122**\n- **Value Gain from Purchase:** -$123,878 (you LOSE money)\n\n**Sale Proceeds:**\n- Sale Price: $2,576,122\n- Closing Costs (6%): -$154,567\n- Net Proceeds: $2,421,555\n- Loan Payoff (after 60 months): -$1,956,392\n- **Net Cash to Seller:** $465,163\n\n**Return Analysis:**\n- Original Equity: $675,000\n- Net Cash: $465,163\n- **Capital Loss: -$209,837** (31% loss)\n- Cumulative Negative Cashflow (5 years): -$100,275\n- **Total Loss: -$310,112**\n\n**Annualized Return:** -9.2%/year\n\n---\n\n### **SCENARIO 2: Refinance Exit**\n\n**Same Assumptions:**\n- Stabilized NOI: $148,117\n- Stabilized Value: $2,576,122\n\n**Refinance at 70% LTV:**\n- New Loan: $1,803,285 (70% of stabilized value)\n- Interest Rate: 7.0%\n- Amortization: 30 years\n- New Monthly Payment: $11,996\n\n**Refi Proceeds:**\n- New Loan: $1,803,285\n- Payoff Existing Loan: -$1,956,392\n- **Net Cash Out: -$153,107** (YOU OWE MONEY AT CLOSING)\n\nYou can't extract equity - you'd need to bring $153K to closing to pay off the old loan.\n\n**Post-Refi DSCR:**\n- New Annual Debt Service: $143,952\n- Stabilized NOI: $148,117\n- **Post-Refi DSCR: 1.03** (barely qualifies)\n\n**Post-Refi Cashflow:**\n- Monthly NOI: $12,343\n- Monthly Debt Service: -$11,996\n- **Monthly Cashflow: $347** (barely positive)\n\nSo after 5 years of bleeding money, you can refi to... break even monthly while still being $675K in the hole.\n\n---\n\n### **SCENARIO 3: Realistic Exit**\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- Realistic NOI: $120,529\n- Add improvements: +$6,520\n- Rent rollback (20% on 50% turnover): -$17,160\n- **Stabilized NOI: $109,889**\n\n**Exit via Sale:**\n- Exit Cap Rate: 6.25% (market adjusts higher for small multifamily risk)\n- **Exit Value:** $109,889 / 0.0625 = **$1,758,224**\n- **Value Loss: -$941,776** (35% loss)\n\n**Sale Proceeds:**\n- Sale Price: $1,758,224\n- Closing Costs: -$105,493\n- Net Proceeds: $1,652,731\n- Loan Payoff: -$1,956,392\n- **Net Cash: -$303,661** (UNDERWATER)\n\nYou're $300K+ underwater on the loan. You'd need to bring cash to closing to sell the property.\n\n**Total Loss:**\n- Value loss: $941,776\n- Cumulative negative cashflow: ~$300,000\n- **Total Destruction: $1,241,776** (46% of purchase price gone)\n\n---\n\n## 7. RISKS / RED FLAGS\n\n### 🚨 **CRITICAL RED FLAGS:**\n\n**1. Deal Fundamentals Are Broken:**\n- DSCR of 0.88 means **won't qualify for 75% LTV financing**\n- Negative cashflow of $1,671/month from day one\n- Would need 40-50% down payment to achieve 1.25 DSCR\n- Banks won't touch this capital structure\n\n**2. Insane Pricing:**\n- $675,000/unit for a 4-plex is **LUXURY CONDO pricing**\n- $457/SF is what you pay for Class A downtown apartments\n- 5.24% cap rate on a 4-unit is **institutional pricing for mom-and-pop risk**\n- You're paying 25-30% over market value\n\n**3. Rents Are Peak/Unsustainable:**\n- Current rents are **40-70% above Phoenix market comps**\n- 1BR at $2,400/month vs market $1,400-1,700\n- 3BR at $4,750/month vs market $2,200-2,800\n- **Massive rollback risk on any turnover** (expect -$4,000-5,000/month)\n\n**4. Expenses Are Fantastically Understated:**\n- $6,556/unit total opex is **BULLSHIT** even for new construction\n- Insurance at $425/unit? Try $875+ minimum\n- Taxes at $803/unit on a $2.7M property? Expect $2,000+/unit post-sale\n- R&M at $1,100/unit? More like $2,000+ minimum\n- **Real expenses are probably $11,000-12,000/unit** ($44K-48K total)\n\n**5. This Is New Construction Flip:**\n- Property was just built in 2024\n- Someone developed this to **flip to a sucker at peak pricing**\n- You're paying for their construction profit + builder margin\n- Developer probably has $1.6-1.8M all-in cost, selling at $2.7M = $900K profit\n\n**6. Small Multifamily Is Hard to Finance/Exit:**\n- 2-4 unit properties fall in the **financing dead zone**\n- Not residential mortgage (>4 units), not institutional (too small)\n- Limited buyer pool on exit\n- Higher cap rates required (6-7%+ typical for 4-plex)\n\n**7. Phoenix Market Is Cooling:**\n- Multifamily rent growth has **stalled in Phoenix 2024**\n- Oversupply of new construction deliveries\n- Population growth slowing from peak 2021-2022 levels\n- Rising property insurance rates (climate risk)\n\n**8. Negative Leverage From Day One:**\n- Cap rate (5.24%) is **below your cost of debt (7%)**\n- Every dollar of leverage **destroys returns** instead of amplifying them\n- Requires massive appreciation just to break even\n\n### **FINANCING RISK:**\n\n- Won't qualify at 75% LTV (DSCR = 0.88)\n- Need 40%+ down to hit 1.25 DSCR = $1.08M cash required\n- Seller carry won't fix this - banks won't allow 20% second lien\n- Can't refi to extract equity (property won't appreciate enough)\n- Stuck with negative cashflow for years\n\n### **OPERATIONAL RISK:**\n\n- **One vacancy = 25% occupancy loss** (only 4 units)\n- Property management is **inefficient at 4 units** (high % fees, no scale)\n- Tenant rollover = rents drop $1,000-2,000/unit to market\n- New construction warranty expires = maintenance costs spike\n- Limited economies of scale on contracts (trash, landscaping, etc.)\n\n### **MARKET RISK:**\n\n- Buying at **peak pricing in a cooling market**\n- Phoenix metro overbuilt on multifamily 2022-2024\n- Remote work reversals could pressure rental demand\n- Climate risk = higher insurance costs ongoing\n- Property tax reassessment post-sale = $5K+ annual increase\n\n### **MISSING CRITICAL DATA:**\n\n- **Who pays utilities?** (If owner, expenses are $12K+ understated)\n- **Actual T12 operating statement** (this is all pro forma bullshit)\n- **Rent roll** (current tenant leases, terms, concessions)\n- **Property inspection report** (even new builds have issues)\n- **Actual market rent comps** (not just broker assertions)\n- **Construction specs/warranties** (what's actually included)\n- **Site visit photos** (is this actually luxury quality?)\n\n---\n\n## 8. FINAL VERDICT\n\n🔴 **PASS**\n\n### **PASS because this is a glorified house-flip disguised as a real estate investment, priced $700K+ over intrinsic value, generating negative cashflow from day one, with rents 50% above market and zero path to profitability.**\n\n---\n\n**Here's the brutal fucking truth:**\n\nSomeone built this property for ~$1.8M all-in (land + construction) and is trying to flip it to you for $2.7M - a **$900K markup** (50% profit) disguised as a \"cash-flowing investment.\"\n\nThe math is completely broken:\n\n- **Won't qualify for financing** (0.88 DSCR)\n- **Loses $1,700/month** from day one (using their bullshit numbers)\n- **Loses $5,200/month** using realistic expenses\n- **Rents are 50% above market** and will crater on turnover\n- **Zero appreciation potential** - you're already overpaying by $700K+\n\nNeither creative financing structure fixes the fundamental problem: **you're paying $2.7M for something worth $2.0M at best, generating cashflow that can't support the debt.**\n\n**Seller carry?** You're hemorrhaging $3,900/month while owing them $540K in 5 years that you can't pay back because the property won't appreciate. You'll default on the note by year 3 when you run out of cash to cover losses.\n\n**Equity partner?** You can't pay their 8% pref, you're losing $6,000+/month out of pocket, and after 5 years you're $442,000 short of what you owe them. They'll sue you for breach of fiduciary duty and probably win.\n\n**The only scenarios where this deal works:**\n\n1. Seller drops price to **$2,000,000** (26% reduction to 6.5% cap)\n2. You enjoy **lighting money on fire** for entertainment\n3. You have **too much money** and need tax losses\n4. You're the seller's **kid or spouse** and this is disguised gift\n\n**What this property is actually worth:**\n\n- At realistic NOI ($120,529) and 6.5% cap rate (appropriate for 4-plex risk)\n- Value = $120,529 / 0.065 = **$1,854,292**\n- You're being asked to pay **$845,708 over intrinsic value** (45% premium)\n\n**What you should offer (if interested):**\n\n- Realistic value: $1,854,292\n- Subtract negotiation room: 10%\n- **Offer: $1,670,000** ($417,500/unit, $283/SF)\n- At this price: 6.95% cap rate, 1.15 DSCR, $600/month positive cashflow\n- Still not great, but at least it's financeable and doesn't bleed money\n\n**But honestly?** Even at $1.67M, there are better opportunities. Phoenix has **hundreds of 1980s-1990s vintage properties** trading at 6-7% caps with:\n- Below-market rents (real upside)\n- Stabilized occupancy (less risk)\n- Reasonable pricing (not paying construction markup)\n- Positive cashflow from day one\n\n🔴 **HARD PASS. This deal is hot garbage wrapped in new construction lipstick. The seller is trying to offload their construction profit onto you while calling it \"investment real estate.\" Don't be the sucker who pays $675K/unit for a 4-plex in Phoenix when you can buy better assets at $300K/unit with actual cashflow and upside.**\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** No amount of creative financing, seller carry, or equity partnership can fix a deal where you're overpaying by $700K-$900K. The fundamentals are broken, the pricing is delusional, and the only creative structure that works is **walking away.**",
